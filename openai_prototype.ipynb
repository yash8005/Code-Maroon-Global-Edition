during a news conference at the Ventura County Fairgrounds..The governor thanked firefighters for their efforts and expressed sympathy for residents who had lost their homes and animals, calling it a “horror” and “terrible tragedy for so many people.”.Brown added that climate change may exacerbate the weather conditions that caused the wildfires to explode..“This is the new normal, and this could

What you should know.Hundreds of firefighters worked all weekend and Monday to get the Lilac Fire under control in north San Diego County and, had great success: As of Tuesday, it was 92 percent contained, Cal Fire said..Where there’s fire, there’s smoke, and San Diegans awoke Monday to a lingering layer of smoke still visible in most parts of the county..Here’s what people should know about the status of the fire and the smoke in the air:  What do authorities say about the air quality in San Diego County?.The air quality in most parts of San Diego County is considered good to moderate, the county’s Air Pollution Control District reported Monday..The Air Pollution Control District put out the following advisories:  In areas of heavy smoke, assume that air quality levels are unhealthy for sensitive groups to unhealthy for all individuals..In areas with minor smoke impacts, assume that air quality levels range from moderate to unhealthy for sensitive groups..In areas where you smell smoke, it is advised that you limit physical activity..If possible, stay indoors to limit your exposure to fine particulate matter..The Air Pollution Control District measures air quality using what’s called the Air Quality Index..Here’s how the control district explains the measurement on its website..Think of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500..The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern..For example, an AQI value of 50 represents good air quality with little potential to affect public health, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality..An AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to the national air quality standard for the pollutant, which is the level EPA has set to protect public health..AQI values below 100 are generally thought of as satisfactory..When AQI values are above 100, air quality is considered to be unhealthy-at first for certain sensitive groups of people, then for everyone as AQI values get higher..Most of the smoke appears to be a result of the Lilac Fire, which has consumed 4,100 acres and continues to burn in the Bonsall area..Some of the smoke that can be seen in southern parts of the county appears to be coming from other fires south of the U.S.-Mexico border near Tijuana..Update: Cal Fire reported a large amount of smoke coming from two fires burning in the Tijuana area on Tuesday..Cal Fire said the fires pose no threat to San Diego and that it would continue to monitor the situation..The parts of the county most impacted by the smoke — with air quality conditions listed as “moderate,” which is worse than “good” but better than “unhealthy for sensitive groups” — are Chula Vista, De.What progress was made over the weekend to get the Lilac Fire under control?.Firefighters made significant progress in the Lilac Fire over the weekend, reducing the threat of further spreading..Evacuation orders were lifted for most areas except for a part of the county just east of Bonsall and south of Fallbrook near the Rancho Monserate Country Club along Olive Hill Road, Cal Fire said Mon.Cal Fire reports that the Lilac Fire has destroyed 151 structures and damaged 56..While dozens of horses have perished in the fires, the Lilac Fire has not killed any people..The cause of the fire remains under investigation..Join me in a conversation: Shoot me a private email with your thoughts or ideas on a different approach to this story..Email: luis.gomez@sduniontribune.com  Twitter: @RunGomez  Read The Conversation on Flipboard..UPDATES:  3:55 p.m., Dec. 12: This article was updated with additional details..This article was originally published Dec. 11 at 11:15 a.m..Editorial: Wildfire is a threat we must all address in San Diego County.After the Lilac Fire exploded into existence Thursday, destroying homes, killing dozens of horses and burning more than 4,000 acres, San Diegans who witnessed deadly wildfires in 2003, 2007 and 2014 f.But while the weekend may have been harrowing for hundreds of firefighters and devastating for those whose animals or houses are now gone, the situation could have been far worse..It’s hard not to look at Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, where the Thomas Fire has become the fifth largest state wildfire since 1932, and not be thankful San Diego sustained so relatively little .Three of the the state’s 10 largest fires, including its biggest in 2003, have been in San Diego..Seeing the damage in Ventura firsthand on Saturday, Gov. Jerry Brown talked about “a new reality in this state, where fires threatened people’s lives, their properties, their neighborhoods and billion.Brown said what many are thinking: that climate change may have caused California’s dangerous fire conditions..It’s unclear if climate change is directly responsible for California’s current dry, hot weather, but what’s clear is that the fire risk is high and rain is nowhere in sight..“This is the new normal, and this could be something that happens every year or every few years,” Brown said..Our friends in New England battled snow this weekend while firefighters fought flames in California..If that’s the new normal, all of us — not just emergency officials — need to be better prepared..Advertisement  On the 10-year anniversary of the 2007 wildfires, which killed 10 people and destroyed more than 1,700 homes in San Diego County, a survey of local residents found 50 percent were ready.And only 38 percent of the people surveyed said they had an emergency plan for wildfires, down from 50 percent in 2007..At the time, The San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board called that survey “a stark reminder that fire safety starts at home.”.In October, the editorial board wrote that political skirmishes between California officials and the Trump administration must not impede needed new and better fire policies..Our suggested policy changes

with the animals and were about to head home when the flames reached the barn filled with expensive thoroughbreds..Catalan and his men made the decision to go into the burning barn to rescue the horses..They opened the gates and implored the horses to run for their lives..Catalan recalled having to jump over flames to get into stalls where some of the horses were shaking and too petrified to move..With the thick smoke bearing down on them, they coaxed 74 of the horses out..But it would take more than a day to locate them and round them all up..The rescued horses are now with Catalan and his crew, who are staying at the Del Mar Racetrack..“There’s a little trauma in our heads, but only when we try to sleep..During the day when we’re working we don’t think about it..But when we try to sleep everything comes back to our minds, everything, everything,” said Catalan..There’s a call by some to bring Spanish-speaking counselors to the track to help Catalan and the others..World-renowned jockey Julie Krone posted the following on her Twitter account asking for help for the grooms who risked their lives and lost all they had while saving the horses..Please if you are Spanish speaking

people and paving a devastating trail of destruction, a San Diego researcher says climate change .“The most unusual thing about this fire season is not the Santa Ana winds, it’s how dry it has been,” said Alexander Gershunov, a research meteorologist with Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UCS.Santa Ana winds typically peak in December and continue through February..The wind events are created by high pressure over the Four Corners region and lower pressure off the coast of California..The pressure gradient causes extreme dry winds to blow from the desert, up over the mountains and all the way to the coast..\"What we clearly see is although there’s not much of a change in Santa Ana wind activity over the last 70 years or so, what we see is that we’re losing precipitation,\" Gershunov said..RELATED: All Evacuation Orders For Lilac Fire Lifted  The wind events this season have exacerbated San Diego County’s historic dry spell, he said..“We’ve had two-tenths of an inch of precipitation and we’re in mid-December,” Gershunov said..According to the National Weather Service, the region should have received nearly 2 inches of rainfall by now, moistening the vegetation and dampening the risk of fire..Associated Press Flames consume a structure as the Lilac fire burns in Bonsall, Calif., on Friday, Dec. 8, 2017..But the last time San Diego received significant rainfall was in March, when the region’s canyons and hills were covered in wildflower super blooms..Nine months later, vegetation is bone dry, putting the entire county at a high risk for fire..Gershunov, who studies long-term records of weather events and weather extremes, said extended dry periods will become a new normal as the climate warms..“What we see is that we’re losing precipitation — basically storms in the autumn and the spring,” Gershunov said..“That’s a trend that’s clearly linked to climate change.”.“What happens with climate change is that the subtropical zone is expanding towards polls, and that basically pushes storms out,” he explained..The longer timeframe of no rainfall means a longer period for vegetation to dry out, and an increased threat of wildfires..A three month weather outlook by NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center shows continued overall warm and dry conditions in San Diego County..Gershunov said the region will be under the threat of wildfires until it rains, and beyond..“Unfortunately, this season is an example of what we expect to see more and more of in the future,” he said..BONSALL, Calif. (KGTV) - The quick thinking of a groomer helped save dozens of horses at San Luis Rey Downs training center in North San Diego County during the Lilac Fire..Leo Tapia said he wasn’t thinking when he

at high risk for wildfires../ Photo by Jamie Scott Lytle  There’s an invisible line where human development meets flammable vegetation, and it’s where the most destruction from wildfires occurs..In San Diego, developers are looking to build nearly 6,000 more homes along this frontline..“When I heard this fire started where it started, with those weather concerns, I was concerned,” North County Fire Protection District Chief Steven Abbott said at a public meeting in Fallbrook Saturda.The Lilac Fire destroyed more than 180 structures, roughly half of which were homes, considered in the wildland urban interface..Nearly 7,500 residents evacuated and several were injured, including firefighters..County leaders may soon decide whether to let developers move forward with projects that would be located in areas of extreme wildfire danger, an approval the projects need because they’re proposed in.In Houston, development decisions may have contributed to the devastation caused by flooding from Hurricane Harvey..In Southern California, the same may be true for wildfires..A 2013 study by the U.S. Geological Survey, for instance, found that sprawl projects built far away from existing development, often called leapfrog development, have led to more houses being lost to .“The first set of homes are going to be in danger because they’ll be surrounded by wildland,” said Jon Keeley, one of the study’s authors..“Leapfrog, without a doubt, leads to the highest loss of homes.”.The safest way to build new housing is to build it near existing housing, the study found..The large development projects still waiting for approval are not just located in severe wildfire risk areas..Some are just on the other side of the I-15 from where the Lilac Fire burned..Some are in the same area as the 2014 Cocos Fire, which destroyed roughly 65 buildings, costing roughly $28.5 million to contain and incurring an estimated $29.8 million in property damage..They’re also near the 2007 Witch Fire, which amounted to roughly $1.3 billion in damages, and the 2003 Cedar Fire, which destroyed 2,820 buildings and killed 15 people..The projects are proposed in northeastern San Diego County because it’s some of the last bare land for development in the county..But that’s exactly why they’re concerning, experts say: The risk is highest when the first developments go in, and eventually subsides when there is a much larger mass of buildings and people like in .One of the projects, Lilac Hills Ranch, proposes roughly 1,700 homes on 600 acres of rolling hills in Valley Center..Harmony Grove South would add 463 homes around the corner from Valiano, another proposed development including 326 homes..Another Harmony Grove project of about 700 homes is already under construction..Newland Sierra, between Vista and Valley Center, would bring another 2,135 homes..Warner Ranch, near Pala, proposes another roughly 780 homes..Keeley said this year’s fires in Napa and Sonoma counties, where more than 40 people died and hundreds of homes and buildings were destroyed, showed the dangers of new development..“That area had fires very similar to the fires they had this year in 1964, but no one died in those fires,” Keeley said..“The primary thing that has changed wasn’t the fire.”.The increase in deaths and destruction was more likely due to the drastic increase in people populating Santa Rosa, he said..Richard Halsey, the director of the California Chaparral Institute, said from the minute you build a home in the wildland-urban interface, it becomes more and more dangerous, as litter builds up, home.It’s not until you reach a certain density, where most of the vegetation is removed from areas, that the danger diminishes..Halsey said he’s concerned about a project in his backyard in Escondido, Safari Highlands..“That was in the fire corridor that the 2007 fire raged through,” he said..“It’s in an area pretty much identical to the area that burned in Santa Rosa, the neighborhoods being taken out by the Thomas Fire right now.”.The large projects all require amendments to the county’s growth blueprint because they would put more density than is currently allowed..The amendments must go through the county’s Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors..Newland Sierra is expected to come before the board in 2018..Decision-makers can impose requirements on the developments that could minimize their fire risk..Valiano, for instance, would need to build new roads leading out of the property to help with evacuation, according to its Fire Protection Plan, a document included in the county’s development review .Harmony Grove Village would build a new fire station if approved..Developers for Lilac Hills Ranch, meanwhile, have not yet proposed how they’ll ensure fire crews can reach homes in the project’s furthest reaches within required fire response timelines – though earl.The most common needs for North County projects, according to the San Diego County Fire Authority, mostly deal with adequate roads into and out of the projects..During the Cocos Fire, traffic gridlocked on Country Club Drive as residents tried to evacuate, according to some accounts..The fire created the same problem for another nearby development, San Elijo Hills, near San Marcos..San Elijo Road led to all three exits out of the development and became gridlocked as thousands of residents fled..Lilac Hills Ranch, which is roughly less than a mile from the Lilac Fire at the closest point of the two and roughly three to four miles from the center of the fire zone to the center of the developme.A 2015 Voice of San Diego investigation found that developers behind the project refused to pay for a new fire station for the more than 3,000 additional residents they would bring in to the area..The project would build 1,746 homes in a mostly rural area where current restrictions allow only 110 homes..In fall 2015, the county’s Planning Commission recommended the Board of Supervisors approve the project, but with several changes – including funding the construction of a new fire station..But instead of agreeing to that stipulation, Lilac Hills’ developers eventually opted to instead put the project before voters last November as Measure B..The initiative also specified ways the project could avoid certain safety investments..For instance, the developer had asked the county for exceptions to various road standards, so they wouldn’t have to flatten hills, or widen country roads to accommodate the influx of traffic the devel.In the initiative, they simply said that West Lilac Road – which was the easternmost boundary of the Lilac Fire, and one of the roads the Planning Commission said needed widening – didn’t need to be c.The Lilac Hills ballot measure failed, but the project and others that would require amendments to the county general plan are not dead..Keeley said there are known avenues to make at-risk developments safer, but politicians need to demand them..“People already know what the best thing to do in those cases is,” Keeley said..“If you ask any fire chief in the county, they’ll tell you, you got to have access roads, you’re going to need a way to get firefighters in the area..Fire chiefs in San Diego County know pretty clearly what makes development risky, and they do have a lot of suggestions how to make those developments succeed..If developers are trying to avoid that, that’s a political question.”.Halsey also said politicians should work on retrofitting existing buildings and homes to improve their fire safety – for example, by putting in automatic external sprinkler systems that could wet the .“If we’ve built in wildland areas, there are things we can do to strengthen them.”.FALLBROOK, Calif.

he spent the day with Iverson’s family, who he said “just spoke about ‘Why Cory?.’”  Mecham said San Diego Fire-Rescue sent eight fire engines so that Cal Fire firefighters most affected by Iverson’s death could take time to grieve..Iverson’s uncle is a retired firefighter with Cal Fire and had worked with current Cal Fire San Diego spokesman Jon Heggie at the fire station in Rainbow..It was during that turn that Heggie met Iverson, who was in his late teens at the time and already eager to become a firefighter..Heggie said he watched Iverson work his way up to becoming a firefighter, and that “you could see the passion that he had at an early age about the fire service.”.“I feel like I had seen him grow up, and I was so proud of him,” Heggie said..Heggie also called Iverson “the kind of firefighter you could rely on..He was the best fireman you could hope to have on your team.”.Iverson brought a positive attitude, and it was no surprise that he “escalated his way up” in the fire

keep up their spirits amid a blackened area that one tra.Late Thursday afternoon a wind-driven fire descended on this 500-stall facility for thoroughbreds..The threat was there but not menacing, until it hit..As a precaution, some horses were being transported to Del Mar in the morning and early afternoon, some 35 miles away from this north San Diego County property, but no one expected the speed with whic.“It went from one minute being, ‘Yeah, we’re going to be OK,’ to ‘Oh, my God, what are we going to do?.’” said trainer Doug O’Neill, who was repeating the words of his chief assistant

30..Advertisement  The only known serious human casualty was trainer Martine Bellocq, who suffered second- and third-degree burns over 50% of her body, according to Jeremy Balan of Bloodhorse..She was

number of customers without power was 19,000..The utility said it has received clearance from fire agencies to start assessing damage in areas blistered by the Lilac Fire..More than 110 SDG&E personnel patrolled and inspected facilities throughout the county for damages and anticipates restoring “a substantial number” of customers..“When it comes to restoring power, it’s all-hands-on-deck,” the utility said earlier in the day..“All available crews, including gas technicians, have been assigned to patrol power lines throughout the day with plans of restoring thousands of customers.”.Two of the utility’s Mobile Command Trailers in the East County have been deployed, providing customers with water, charging for mobile devices and a wi-fi spot..They are located at:  Caltrans Park & Ride, Lot 29, 7838 Japatul Valley Road, Descanso, CA (North of the Intersection of Highway 79 and Interstate 8)  Lake Morena Community Park, 2550 Lake Morena Dr, .The weather forecast for Friday called for less windy conditions, which helped utility crews because the process of restoring power to downed neighborhoods requires reduced wind speeds for a sustained.Field crews also need about four to eight hours of daylight to patrol an entire span of a power line..At the same time, the utility said improved weather conditions are not the only factor when it comes to bringing the power back on..“It is difficult to predict how long a patrol might take given the varied length of each power line, the terrain, and whether aerial patrols are required,” SDG&E officials said in a news release..Some power circuits are located in rural, mountainous areas that required a helicopter to patrol and the choppers need wind speeds below 35 mph to fly safely..SDG&E’s outage map showed power shutoffs concentrated in the backcountry and North County areas, although a few isolated areas in more urban locales have also been affected..Among the communities affected are portions of Live Oak Springs, Boulevard, Jacumba, Japatul Valley, Buckman Springs, Morena Village, West Descanso, Boulder Creek, Valley Center, Rincon, Pauma Valley,.SDG&E officials said power may remain out for several days in some areas..As for the cause of the Lilac Fire that started Thursday afternoon in the Bonsall area that has destroyed at least 85 homes, SDG&E said, “Based on preliminary reports

volunteers pour into Del Mar in wake of fires.For the first time in a decade, the Del Mar racetrack went from showcase to shelter for more than 800 horses evacuated from wildfires that broke out across Southern California last week, including the.When the Lilac fire broke out the afternoon of Dec. 7, Del Mar mobilized its disaster response and braced for evacuations on a scale not seen since the 2007 fires..One of the racetrack’s first actions was to send out word on social media calling for volunteers and donations..By midnight, some 175 volunteers had pitched in as horses arrived seeking shelter..Many had been evacuated from the San Luis Rey Downs, a training facility in Bonsall that housed 500 thoroughbreds..Horses there were set loose as the Lilac fire engulfed the facility..Three-quarters of San Luis Rey was destroyed and nearly 50 thoroughbreds died..At 10 a.m. Friday, Dec. 8, trucks and trailers were queued up hundreds of yards outside Stable Gate as donations of food and clothing — and even more volunteers — poured in..George Bradvica, a fairgrounds official who helped coordinate the volunteer response, took pause as volunteers frantically divvied up apples and carrots into feed buckets before heading out to the sta.Like so many of the fairgrounds’ workers, Bradvica was on site day and night throughout the crisis..“Everyone knows what their role is,” Bradvica said..“We all got out here, we knew what we were doing, and we just started the process.”.Many of those stories were recounted Tuesday, Dec. 12, at the monthly meeting of the 22nd District Agricultural Association, which runs the fairgrounds..“The support from the community was absolutely overwhelming,” said Russ Penniman, president of the DAA board of directors..By the evening of Dec. 12, when officials wound down their volunteer response, more than 3,000 volunteers had applied to help out..The pile of donated clothing is so huge that it’s still being folded and sorted out..“No one was underfed, particularly if you like pizza or apples or carrots,” Penniman said, drawing a knowing laugh from the three dozen people at the DAA meeting..Among the audience was Dan DeSousa, the county’s animal services director, who struck a grateful note while describing the anguish animal owners feel in times of crisis..“Knowing that they have this place here allows them to evacuate, keeps them safe, keeps the animals safe,” he told the DAA board, breaking off to choke back the emotion..“You guys are a godsend to the community and we cannot say thank you enough.”.Lessons learned? Lilac Fire tested strategies drawn from ‘07 and ‘03 fires.After more than a decade of studying wildfires, San Diego County took its final exams last week..Authorities say the region is far better equipped to handle swift, wind-whipped flames than it was during the firestorms of 2007 and ’03..“We’re about $460 million more prepared,” Supervisor Dianne Jacob said Friday, “both on the ground and in the air.”.Officials cited better communication between fire agencies; more fire engines and air tankers on the front lines, day and night; and better tracking of the flames..Advertisement  Despite these advances, the Lilac Fire’s first 24 hours consumed 4,100 acres and 85 structures..“Remember, this was a wind-driven fire,” Cal Fire Capt. Kendal Bortisser said..“The crews were trying to stay out ahead of this as quickly as they could and, as we know, when a tornado hits the Midwest, there’s no stopping it..When a hurricane hits the East Coast, there’s no stopping it..“When the Santa Ana winds come through, there’s no stopping them.”.A look at what worked, and what didn’t:  Air power  In 2003 and ’07, firefighters often looked up and wondered..U.S. Forest Service and Cal Fire helicopters and air tankers had been grounded at sundown to minimize the risk of crashes..Local military commanders insisted they had no authority to dispatch their aerial assets..In the Lilac Fire’s first 24 hours, 15 helicopters and seven air tankers attacked the flames..This fleet included two helicopters from the Marine Corps and two from the Navy..San Diego Gas & Electric scrambled its massive helitanker, which doused hot spots with 2,650 gallons of water..Pilots also deployed technology that was unavailable in 2007: infrared cameras, which helped them track hot spots at night..Collaboration and conflict  In many ways, the Lilac Fire looked like a model of cooperation..City, county, state and federal agencies worked side by side..There was even a crew of inmates from Nevada City, creating fire breaks in Bonsall..These disparate units were guided by the Emergency Operations Center in Kearny Mesa..“This is important for providing timely, accurate information to first responders and the public,” said Alex Bell, a spokesperson for the county Office of Emergency Services and Fire Authority..Despite this evidence of harmony, the fire illuminated enduring tensions between county Supervisor Jacob and San Diego Gas & Electric..“I’m very concerned about SDG&E’s policy of de-energizing or shutting off power in the rural areas where people and in many cases the fire agencies depend on well water,” Jacob said Friday..“You can’t get the well water without electricity so that could pose an additional danger.”.While unaware of any such instances last week, Jacob added, “I just hope that it does not..I don’t have a lot of confidence in that, but let’s hope.”.A utility spokeswoman called these comments “insulting,” saying employees had worked ceaselessly to ensure public safety..Between Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, SDG&E cut power to about 17,000 customers in what the utility called a proactive measure..High winds can sometimes cause power lines to fall, sparking fires..Cal Fire and the California Public Utilities Commission traced numerous 2007 fires to downed utility wires..Another blaze erupted when a Cox Communications wire lashed an SDG&E power line..Last week, Jacob applauded when the PUC denied SDG&E’s request that ratepayers cover $379 million in costs from the 2007 fires..The ruling, the supervisor said, “brings some justice against a utility that cares more about shareholder profits than public safety.”.Weather  Since 2010, SDG&E has planted 170 small weather stations across the county..“It’s the largest utility weather network in the country,” said Brian D’Agostino, manager of the utility’s meteorology program..There were no stations inside the Lilac Fire, but two were to the east and one to the south..From those stations, D’Agostino knew that the fire began in an area hit by 30 mph winds and dried by low — 4 percent — humidity..“Then we fed the information into fire behavior modeling systems,” D’Agostino said..“We have the ability then to run a fire simulation, that tells us how fast a fire will grow and in what direction it will go.”.This information, in turn, informs the utility’s Fire Potential Index, a daily report sent to the county’s fire agencies..SDG&E also gives a mobile app to firefighters; the data is posted at sdgeweather.com..“It has all been a big work in progress,” D’Agostino said..Planning  Firefighting agencies across the county spent thousands of hours and millions of dollars preparing for this conflagration..Some observers, though, say the most critical fire planning should be done by residential developers..Ignoring a building site — how the land funnels winds, say, or how close homes are to flammable flora — can have lethal consequences..“Imagine placing your home on top of a locomotive track,” said Christopher Dicus, professor of wildlands fire and fuels management at California Polytechnic University San Luis Obispo, “and then you t.While Southern California has entered a new era of wildfires of increasing frequency and severity, Richard Halsey said authorities seem stuck in the past..“Departments and bureaucrats and politicians all say the right things,” said Halsey, founder of the California Chaparral Institute..“But when you look at what’s happening on the ground, people are dying and homes are burning, and that’s wrong.”.Planners still site luxury developments next to wild lands — Halsey pointed to the Safari Highlands proposal north of the zoo’s Safari Park — and overlook creative approaches to defeating fire..In Colorado and Australia, for instance, some are installing rooftop sprinklers..Drawing from an onsite reservoir, the systems rapidly drench a home’s exterior..“You push a button, flip a valve and in a matter of moments the house is in a cascade of water,” Halsey said..But innovation “is not conducive to your career,” Halsey said..“I’m so frustrated over the unwillingness to examine new solutions.”.Reporter Rob Nikolewski contributed to this story..Wildfire destroys mobile homes in California retirement park.Wildfire destroys mobile homes in California
