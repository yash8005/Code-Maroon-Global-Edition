Hurricane Sally Slowly Creeping Toward Gulf Coast With Potentially Historic and Life-Threatening Flooding.

At a Glance Hurricane Sally is moving very slowly in the northern Gulf of Mexico..

Sally's slow movement will result in prolonged impacts on the Gulf Coast..

Life-threatening storm surge is expected, particularly in parts of Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle..

Flooding rain is a major threat from Sally on the Gulf Coast and farther inland across the Southeast this week..

Rainfall totals of up to 30 inches could result in historic flooding near and just inland from the northern Gulf Coast..

Damaging winds are expected near where Sally's center crosses the coast..

Hurricane Sally is moving very slowly toward the northern Gulf Coast, where it will bring potentially historic flooding rainfall, a dangerous storm surge and damaging winds through Wednesday..

Sally will also pose a threat of flooding rainfall farther inland across parts of the Southeast..

Flooding, power outages and bridge closures have already spread throughout coastal Alabama and northwestern Florida and dangerous conditions will persist through Wednesday there..

(LATEST: Power Outages and Flooding Spread as Sally Batters Gulf Coast)  Current Alerts  A hurricane warning has been issued from east of Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to the Okaloosa/Walton County line.

Sally churns towards Alabama landfall - Alabama Now.

GULFPORT, Miss. (AP) — Hurricane Sally, a plodding storm with winds of 85 mph (137 kph), crept toward the northern Gulf Coast on Tuesday as forecasters warned of potentially deadly storm surges and fl.

Forecasters said the storm’s drifting pace made it difficult to predict precisely where the storm’s eye would make landfall..

But they kept nudging the predicted track eastward, easing fears in New Orleans, which was once in Sally’s crosshairs..

By late morning Tuesday, hurricane warnings stretched from east of Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to Navarre, Florida, and forecasters said Sally should reach land near the Alabama-Mississippi state line.

Rainfall of up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) was forecast near the coast, with a chance the storm could also spawn tornadoes..

Stacy Stewart, a senior specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Tuesday that people should continue to take the storm seriously since “devastating” rainfall is expected in large areas..

“This is going to be historic flooding along with the historic rainfall,” Stewart said..

“If people live near rivers, small streams and creeks, they need to evacuate and go somewhere else.”.

Along the I-10 highway that runs parallel to the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Florida, rain was starting to intensify in places like Gautier and Pascagoula, Mississippi..

Businesses along highway exits appeared to be largely closed..

Pascagoula police tweeted video of rising seawater flowing across a coastal roadway..

In Gulfport, Mississippi, white plastic bags hung over some gas station pumps to signal they were out of fuel..

Along a bayou that extended inland from the Gulf, three shrimp boats were tied up as shrimpers and others tried to protect their boats from waves and storm surge..

Most boat slips at Gulfport’s marina were empty, and many businesses had metal storm shutters or plywood covering the windows..

In Alabama, officials closed the causeway to Dauphin Island and the commuter tunnel that runs beneath the Mobile River..

An online video from Dauphin Island showed a few cars and SUVs stuck in a beachfront area, their tires sunk deep into wet sand..

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey urged residents near Mobile Bay and low-lying areas near rivers to evacuate if conditions still permitted a safe escape..

The National Hurricane Center predicted storm surge along Alabama’s coast, including Mobile Bay, could reach 7 feet (2.1 meters) above ground..

“This is not worth risking your life,” Ivey said during a news conference Tuesday..

The storm was moving at only 2 mph (4 kph) late Tuesday morning, centered about 110 miles (180 kilometers) south of Mobile, Alabama, and 55 miles (85 kilometers) east of the mouth of the Mississippi R.

Hurricane-force winds stretched 45 miles (75 kilometers) from its center..

Forecasters expected Sally to move slowly northward Tuesday, with the storm’s center bypassing the coast of southeastern Louisiana..

Forecasters said the storm should remain a Category 1 hurricane, with top winds of 85 mph (137 kph), until it comes ashore..

After making landfall, Sally was forecast to cause flash floods and minor to moderate river flooding across inland portions of Mississippi, Alabama, northern Georgia and the western Carolinas through .

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared an emergency in the Panhandle’s westernmost counties, which were being pummeled by rain from Sally’s outer bands early Tuesday..

President Donald Trump issued emergency declarations for parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama on Monday, and tweeted that residents should listen to state and local leaders..

Gulf waters had already crept over swaths of sandy shore and infiltrated bike paths and parking lots..

Its maximum sustained winds dwindled to a Category 1 by early Tuesday, and forecasters did not predict further strengthening..

While the threat to Louisiana appeared to be easing, flood control authorities remained on guard, closing gates along networks of waterways that could overflow their banks from storm surge..

None of the others were expected to threaten the U.S. this week, if at all..

One was downgraded to a low pressure trough Monday evening..

Hurricane Sally's slow crawl toward Gulf Coast could trigger 'historic' flooding.

Mobile, Alabama (CNN) Heavy rain and wind gusts began punishing parts Alabama and Florida on Tuesday as Hurricane Sally slowly creeps toward the US Gulf Coast, where millions of people are preparing f.

The center of Sally -- a Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph -- was more than 50 miles south of Dauphin Island, Alabama, and moving toward land at only 2 mph, the National Hurrican.

That's slower than the average human walking pace..

Conditions were quickly deteriorating Tuesday, leaving piers destroyed along the coast and more than 18,000 customers without power in Alabama, Mississippi and Florida, according to PowerOutage.US..

"We are flooded in and cannot see the homes on the beach," Doris Stiers told CNN from a beach house near Gulf Shores, Alabama..

Sally's center is expected to make landfall late Tuesday or Wednesday morning, forecasters say, but the storm is likely going to be moving over the same area for days..

"You could get four to five months of rain in just a matter of two to three days," CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray said..

While some families in Mobile are waiting out the storm at home, Linda Duke was growing nervous and instead opted to drive to a motel..

"We are going to leave for the night" Duke, 75, told CNN..

"We are only worried if we get a big storm surge because the ground is so wet and the house is so old, over 100 years old.".

A hurricane warning is in effect from Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, through just east of Pensacola, Florida -- including all of coastal Alabama and the city of Mobile..

Sally's center is expected to move near southeastern Louisiana before hitting land -- perhaps near the Mississippi-Alabama state line, forecasters said..

Its slow movement should allow huge amounts of rain to pile up even ahead of landfall..

Hurricane conditions could arrive in the warning area Tuesday evening or early Wednesday, forecasters say..

Outer rain bands already were hitting parts of coastal Alabama and the Florida Panhandle..

About 10 to 30 inches of rain are possible by storm's end from the Florida Panhandle to far southeastern Mississippi, forecasters say..

"Historic life-threatening flash flooding is likely," the NHC said in its latest advisory..

Tornadoes also are possible through Wednesday, especially in parts of southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, forecasters say..

Water was already flooding roads in Pascagoula, Mississippi on Tuesday..

Katrina survivor prepares for Sally  As the storm approached Monday, Mississippian Mike Taylor prepared by filling and placing sandbags around his house in Long Beach, near Gulfport, to keep water out.

A driver navigates along a flooded road as the outer bands of Hurricane Sally come ashore Tuesday morning in Bayou La Batre, Alabama..

Taylor lost his home 15 years ago during Hurricane Katrina ..

It sat just a few blocks from the beach front, he said..

Taylor evacuated as the storm surge moved closer, and when he returned only a slab was left..

One of the few belongings he found in the debris was a toy truck that he still keeps in his house..

Taylor isn't nervous about Hurricane Sally because he believes he has already experienced a worse storm, he said..

As he helped Taylor fill sandbags, he told CNN he's worried..

The storm is coming at night and the wind can blow your house down," the boy said..

A lifelong Gulf Coast resident, 35-year-old Robert Higdon also filled sandbags in the Gulfport area..

He said he is not terribly concerned about this hurricane but knows it's best to "prepare for the unexpected.".

Gulf of Mexico storms can quickly intensify , he said, so he always assumes the hurricane is going to be a little worse than the official forecast predictions..

"I'd rather be prepared for the unexpected," Higdon said..

"If it's a Category 2 or below we just bunker down..

"  Storm threats  Some of the storm's main threats, forecasters say:  Dangerous , including 4 to 7 feet from the Mississippi-Alabama line to the Alabama-Florida line..

Storm surge of 3 to 5 feet also is possible from the Louisiana-Mississippi line to the Mississippi-Alabama line, forecasters said..

storm surge , including 4 to 7 feet from the Mississippi-Alabama line to the Alabama-Florida line..

The storm's sluggishness could mean lengthy surges -- perhaps multiple high-tide periods over 36 hours..

"You can just imagine the saltwater that's going to push in, as well as the freshwater coming down in the form of rain," Gray said..

The 10-30 inches forecast for some coastal areas would mean several months' worth of rain..

Flash flooding is possible not only there, but also well inland, forecasters say..

About 4 to 12 inches of rain could fall in parts of southeastern Mississippi, central Alabama, northern Georgia and the western Carolinas though Saturday..

Sally's slow pace means areas where the storm crosses land may experience winds of at least tropical-storm strength (39 mph and higher) for more than 30 hours, including hurricane-force winds..

Scientists believe climate change is influencing hurricanes and making their impacts worse, and Sally looks to be checking all their boxes -- including its slow forward speed..

Residents and visitors get ready in Alabama  In Bayou La Batre, a coastal Alabama town just southwest of Mobile, Ian Fields on Monday secured his boat on the bayou where he and his family plan to ride.

That's about as prepared as we are," he told CNN affiliate WALA  Residents in Montgomery, Alabama, were filling sandbags Tuesday in preparation for possible flooding..

Fields has ridden out past storms, though he has a backup plan just in case his family needs to leave this time, he said..

"I'm just waiting for it to come and go," he told the station..

Jerry Gunderson cut short his vacation on Alabama's Dauphin Island because of Sally, he told WALA ..

Still many hours from landfall, the storm was also complicating his evacuation..

"We had booked a home to go to in Mobile, and they just called and said that a tree fell through the house, so right now we're trying to find other accommodations," he said..

Evacuations ordered along the coast  The governors of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi have requested emergency federal assistance ahead of the storm and each has declared a state of emergency  The .

Mandatory evacuations have been announced along the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama..

Residents in Louisiana's Plaquemines Parish, St. Charles Parish and parts of Jefferson Parish have been told to evacuate as flooding and storm surge are expected..

Latest NHC update:Hurricane Sally winds weaken slightly; forecasters warn of storm surge, flooding  Sally did weaken slightly overnight to a Category 1 storm due to ingesting some drier air, but thund.

Regardless of the intensity, Howell said it's important for residents to focus on the rainfall — not the wind speed — of Sally..

“Inland freshwater flooding, as well as storm surge flooding, make up over half of our fatalities from all tropical cyclones,” Howell said..

“Flooding is the greatest threat and risk associated with a hurricane, as compared to the winds..

… we definitely need to pay close attention to this, and make sure that if you live in a low-lying area or in a flood-prone area, that you’re ready to get to higher ground.”.

A slight shift east in Sally's track means she's expected to make landfall along the Alabama/Mississippi border Tuesday night or Wednesday morning..

Nearly an inch of rain fell in Pensacola between midnight and 5 a.m..

Jim Cantore makes landfall on Pensacola Beach as Hurricane Sally bears down on Gulf Coast.

If you weren't paying attention to Hurricane Sally before, you will now: Jim Cantore is officially on Pensacola Beach..

The famed Weather Channel weatherman notorious for reporting from some of the worst weather situations in the country arrived at Pensacola Beach on Tuesday evening..

He tweeted a video from Quietwater Beach, which is experiencing significant flooding as Sally continues to bear down on the coast..

"Getting pretty nasty on the bay side of Pensacola Beach," he tweeted..

At 6 p.m., in a graphic showing of all of its reporters fanned out across the Gulf Coast, the Weather Channel showed Cantore in Pensacola..

Cantore was first in New Orleans over the weekend when the storm's track had it making landfall in southeastern Louisiana, and then shifted to Gulfport, Mississippi, on Monday..

As Sally continued shifting east, Cantore followed, bringing him to Pensacola Beach on Tuesday night..

Cantore's presence isn't exactly welcome in the area..

In 2018, as Hurricane Michael marched toward the Panhandle, the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office issued a playful "no trespass" warning to the star meteorologist..

The warning — complete with photos and a physical description of the weather man — identifies Cantore as a "person of interest" and adds that the SRSO would prefer he make "non-business related visits.

Weather conditions on Pensacola Beach and throughout the area are expected to continue deteriorating heading into Tuesday night and Wednesday morning..

Hurricane Sally Is a Slow-Moving Threat. Climate Change Might Be Why..

In Bayou La Batre, Ala., where Sally was already turning roads into rivers on Tuesday, Ernest Nelson, a retired commercial fisherman, reached a similar conclusion as he sought refuge under a house rai.

Storms were getting bigger and more intense, he said..

Mr. Nelson, who had worked the water for decades, gave his basis for that belief: “No meteorologist..

On Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center reported that Sally’s translation speed, the rate at which it moves forward, was about 2 miles per hour, and that the storm was not expected to accelerate muc.

It was stalling, in effect, as it approached the Mississippi coast..

But rather than serve as a source of comfort, its languid speed only intensified the unease: Sally, which intensified into a Category 2 storm early Wednesday, is dangerous, meteorologists warned, prec.

Its lingering could translate into major flooding, with more rain than the region typically records over several months..

Hurricane Paulette, by contrast, was zipping along in the Atlantic on Tuesday with a translation speed of more than 25 m.p.h. after passing Bermuda two days earlier..

A year ago, Dorian crawled over the Bahamas for a day and a half, causing widespread destruction from wind and storm surge..

And Harvey, perhaps the best-known — and most costly — example of stalling, was no longer a hurricane by the time it slowed near Houston in August 2017..

It had been downgraded to a tropical storm, but still it inundated the city and surrounding communities with four feet or more of rain over several days..

Here's how homeowners can prepare for insurance claims after Hurricane Sally.

The slow-moving Category 1 storm in the Gulf of Mexico was packing winds of 85 mph Tuesday morning as it crawled north toward the coastline of Mississippi, Alabama and northwestern Florida..

Strong winds, a dangerous storm surge and heavy rainfall totaling 10 inches to 20 inches — 30 inches in some isolated spots — could end up leaving a trail of destruction that may mean months of cleanu.

On its current track, the center of Sally is expected to make landfall late Tuesday or on Wednesday..

At that point, the storm is forecast to move inland on Wednesday and track across the Southeast toward northern Georgia and the western parts of the Carolinas..

Amid the emotional upheaval caused by natural disasters, anticipating an insurance claim in advance can mean one less stressor if a worst-case scenario unfolds..

Do a home inventory  One of the easiest ways to document the condition of your house and belongings is to take pictures — lots of them..

You should get shots of both inside and outside from various angles and be as thorough as you can..

The idea is to have proof not only of what you own, but also what kind of shape it was in before the storm..

If you can't prove the prior condition of a damaged item or aspect of your house (i.e., missing shutters, siding, etc.), there may be snags or denials in the claims process if the insurance company ha.

Then, "store everything on a flash drive so you can easily take it with you if you need to evacuate," Friedlander said..

Review and understand your coverage  The declarations page of your insurance policy is a summary that offers details on how much coverage you have, your deductibles and how a claim will be paid, Fried.

If you have questions, you should contact your agent..

Most homeowners insurance comes with a hurricane deductible..

It typically ranges from about 1% to 5%, depending on the specifics of your insurance contract..

Note that the percentage is based on your insured value, not the damage caused..

So if your home is insured for $200,000 and you have a 2% hurricane deductible, you'll pay $4,000 whether the damage is $5,000 or $50,000..

When a homeowner faces storm-related damage that is uncovered but in a federally declared disaster zone, there might be government programs that can provide financial assistance through grants or loan.

However, that help is not guaranteed, and it likely wouldn't get you quickly back on your feet..

For instance, after 2017′s Hurricane Harvey, which dumped as much as 60 inches of rain in some spots in Texas, the average grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for individuals was $7,000.

Incidentally, you can check your flood risk at realtor.com, which has started including that information alongside other details about properties..

After the storm  If you end up with damage from Sally, you should reach out to your agent, Friedlander said..

He said to find out if the damage is covered, whether the loss would likely exceed your deductible and how long the claims process will take..

You'll receive claim forms, which must be sent to you within a specified time period based on state regulations, Friedlander said..

Hurricane Sally Is Bringing 'History-Making' Rains To Gulf Coast, Forecasters Say.

Hurricane Sally Is Bringing 'History-Making' Rains To Gulf Coast, Forecasters Say  Enlarge this image toggle caption NOAA/Esri/HERE/NPS NOAA/Esri/HERE/NPS  Updated at 6:15 a.m. ET Wednesday  Hurricane.

The hurricane is crawling along at just 2 mph, giving its heavy rains even more potential impact..

"Because of that slow movement, we're going to see torrential rainfall, a dangerous amount of rainfall," National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham said in an online briefing Tuesday morning..

Many communities in Sally's path will be drenched by 10 to 20 inches of rain, with some areas possibly seeing up to 30 inches..

"That's just a history-making amount of rain," Graham said..

The National Hurricane Center said the center of Sally's eye landed at Gulf Shores, Ala., about 4:45 a.m. local time (5:45 a.m. ET) as a Category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph..

Sally's projected landfall has shifted consistently toward the east; and as of Tuesday evening the hurricane warning area stretches from Bay St. Louis, Miss., to Navarre in the northwest Florida panha.

The center of the hurricane is forecast to move inland across southeastern Alabama Wednesday night and Thursday..

"This will be a PROLONGED event given the slow movement of Sally," the NHC said, warning of a life-threatening storm surge, strong winds and "significant likely historic flooding.".

A large part of the coast is under a storm surge warning, from the New Orleans area to the western Florida Panhandle..

Parts of Alabama and Florida are under a tornado watch until Wednesday at 7 a.m. ET..

The National Weather Service also issued a flash flood warning for most of north and central Georgia from Wednesday afternoon through Friday morning, due to anticipated heavy rainfall from the storm's.

In a Tuesday evening briefing, Graham warned of the dangers of "repetitive rain" and significant storm surge from the slow-moving hurricane..

"Water is the leading cause of fatalities in these tropical systems historically, and that's what we have here," he said..

Federal emergencies have been declared in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana, with President Trump approving disaster requests from those states' governors..

Parts of the western Florida Panhandle and Alabama are seeing tropical storm conditions, and the situation is expected to deteriorate..

Those same areas were included in a tornado watch bulletin the National Weather Service issued Tuesday..

Ivey on Monday urged residents and tourists along the Alabama coast to evacuate..

In Mississippi, mandatory evacuation orders have been issued for parts of Harrison and Hancock counties..

The state's emergency agency also warns, "Shelters will operate at limited capacity because of COVID-19 guidelines.".

Enlarge this image toggle caption NOAA/NESDIS/STAR GOES-East NOAA/NESDIS/STAR GOES-East  A voluntary evacuation order is also in effect for parts of Jackson County..

In Florida, Santa Rosa and Escambia counties are under voluntary evacuation orders..

Strong winds have already forced several bridges to close in the Pensacola area, including Three Mile Bridge over Pensacola Bay..

In Louisiana, Sally's eastward shift prompted at least two parishes – St. Charles and St. John the Baptist — to rescind their evacuation orders late Tuesday morning..

But other areas with more exposure to the Gulf, such as St. Bernard Parish, are already coping with flooding that began Monday..

A tropical storm warning for New Orleans was lifted Tuesday morning, providing relief in a city that is sheltering people who fled Hurricane Laura's arrival in the Lake Charles area weeks ago..

The storm's rain bands, combined with a storm surge of up to 7 feet, are expected to produce dangerous floods..

Forecasters reduced their storm surge predictions late Tuesday morning after earlier projecting a maximum surge of 9 or even 11 feet..

A storm surge warning, meaning there is a danger of life-threatening inundation by waters along the coast, is in effect from the mouth of the Mississippi River to the Okaloosa/Walton county line in Fl.

Sally is currently moving northwest, but its path is expected to curl northward and then a bit to the east..

The timing of those maneuvers is uncertain, leaving its projected path in doubt as people rush to prepare for strong winds and high water..

After Sally makes landfall, flooding risks will spread farther inland, eventually reaching northern Georgia and the western sections of South Carolina and North Carolina later this week, forecasters s.

Sally rapidly strengthened on Monday, with sustained winds of 100 mph..

That prompted forecasters to say it could have winds of up to 110 mph when it makes landfall..

Those estimates have now been lowered, and the storm is expected to be a Category 1 hurricane when it finally arrives..

Sally is expected to remain at tropical storm strength or higher until early Thursday..

Slow-moving Hurricane Sally crawls toward Wednesday landfall, threatens to bring 'historic' flooding to Gulf Coast.

KILN, Miss. — Hurricane Sally intensified again to a Category 2 storm early Wednesday on its lumbering journey to the Gulf Coast, threatening to bring heavy rains and "historic life-threatening floodi.

Tropical-storm-force winds arrived onshore along the Gulf Coast on Tuesday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said, adding that the center of the storm would "make landfall in the hurricane warn.

The National Weather Service office in Mobile, Alabama, projected late Tuesday night that Sally would come ashore around 7 a.m. Wednesday near Orange Beach, on Alabama's eastern Gulf Coast between Mob.

Sally, which was downgraded to Category 1 on Tuesday before strengthening again as it moved closer to landfall, was 60 miles south-southeast of Mobile and 55 miles southwest of Pensacola at 1 a.m. CDT.

The storm, traveling at just 2 mph, had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph..

“It’s going to be a huge rainmaker,” said Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist and meteorologist at Colorado State University..

There's only one name left on the 2020 list of hurricane names..

Sally will be the eighth named storm to make landfall in the continental U.S. this year — the most through Sept. 16 in recorded history, surpassing the seven storms of 1916, Klotzbach said Tuesday nig.

The record for most continental U.S. landfalls in a single Atlantic season is nine, also set in 1916..

The storms's dangers will be felt for miles with hurricane warnings in effect from east of Bay St. Louis, Louisiana, to Navarre, Florida..

“There is going to be historic flooding along with the historic rainfall,” Stacy Stewart, a senior specialist with the Hurricane Center, said Tuesday..

The Hurricane Center said the storm's center will continue to move slowly to the northwest and north on Tuesday as it nears the coast of southeastern Louisiana..

It will then turn northeast as it comes ashore and continues to trudge across the Southeast later in the week..

Forecasters say Sally could bring 10 to 20 inches of rain from the Florida Panhandle to southeast Mississippi, with some isolated pockets of rain up to 30 inches..

The rain along and just inland of the coast could bring "historic life-threatening flash flooding" through Wednesday, the Hurricane Center said..

Up to seven feet of storm surge was also forecast across Alabama's coastline from the Mississippi border to Florida border, forecasters said..

Isolated tornadoes could also occur Wednesday across portions of the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama, according to the Hurricane Center..

Hurricane Sally travel issues:United, Delta, American, Southwest, Spirit, JetBlue issue flight waivers  As it moves inland, Sally could also dump up to a foot of rain along pockets of southeastern Mis.

President Donald Trump issued emergency declarations for parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama on Monday..

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties, along the western part of the Panhandle, which already was being pummeled with rain from Sally's outer band.

Outside Pensacola, Quietwater Beach was completely underwater and county public works employees could be seen wading through knee-high water to secure trash cans and other items..

The Pensacola Bay Bridge also closed Tuesday morning amid wind and rain, and over the course of the day, it is likely that more and more routes to coastal communities will be cut off..

In Alabama, Gov. Kay Ivey also issued a state of an emergency closing Alabama's beaches..

The causeway to Dauphin Island, which was already flooding, was closed, and downtown Mobile was nearly deserted..

Ivey warned residents living along the Gulf, especially south of Interstate 10 or in low-lying areas, to evacuate if conditions permit..

Sally had threatened to batter New Orleans, where thousands of evacuees from Hurricane Laura were staying, but turned east over the past day..

Laura devastated much of southwestern Louisiana after it roared ashore as a Category 4 storm, the first major hurricane of the 2020 season..

In Mississippi, Hurricane Katrina was on the minds of some residents preparing for Sally's deluge..

Sabrina Young of Bay St. Louis was at the Kiln shelter Monday..

It was the first of several to open around the region as evacuations of low-lying areas began..

“(The people will) be coming but it will be too late," she said. ".

I did that with Katrina – the clothes on our backs and that was it..

Others appeared unsure what to do and planned to ride out the storm at home..

Kenneth Belcher of Ocean Springs said he's worried about the storm but has little choice other than to stay at his apartment..

"They say it's going to be a bad one," Belcher said..

We got lucky with (Hurricane) Laura, but this one looks like it's coming to us..

"  Some Gulf Coast residents in Mississippi were taking Sally’s approach in stride..

Well, I have – not them,” she said, referring to her two children playing on the beach in Gulfport..

Seven houses from the beach, the Bourgeois home is 30 feet above sea level and 12 feet off the ground. ”.

Hurricane Sally crawls toward coast; Landfall location unclear, but deluge of rain certain - Magnolia State Live.

Hurricane Sally, a plodding storm with winds of 85 mph (137 kph), crept toward the northern Gulf Coast early Tuesday as forecasters warned of potentially deadly storm surges and flash floods with up t.

Forecasters stressed “significant” uncertainty as to where the storm’s eye would make landfall..

By early Tuesday, hurricane warnings stretched from the mouth of the Pearl River at the Louisiana-Mississippi line to Navarre, Florida, and forecasters said Sally should reach land near the Alabama-Mi.

In Gulfport, Mississippi, twin hurricane warning flags popped in the wind Tuesday morning at a marina and the sea had risen enough to cover an area normally used for bonfires in the sand..

Most boat slips at the marina were empty, and many businesses in town were closed, metal storm shutters or plywood covering the windows..

The storm was moving at only 2 mph (4 kph) Tuesday morning, centered about 105 miles (169 kilometers) south-southeast of Biloxi, Mississippi, and 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of the mouth of the Mis.

Forecasters expect Sally to turn northward Tuesday afternoon, moving near the coast of southeastern Louisiana later in the day, and then travel slowly north-northeastward through Wednesday, remaining .

Ivey urged residents Tuesday to stay vigilant and heed any emergency warnings..

While the threat to Louisiana appeared to be easing, flood control authorities remained on guard, closing gates along networks of waterways that could be pushed over their banks by the possible surge .

People along the coast appeared to be taking the storm seriously even as it remained offshore..

Motorists filled a convenience store parking lot in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, as they topped off gas tanks and stocked up on ice, beer and snacks..

As of 7 p.m. Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center reported hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles..

We did the math and broke it down for you:  • Sally was about 250 miles across, with the hurricane-force winds about 80 miles in diameter..

To compare, the state of Maryland is 250 miles long and 90 miles wide..

• At 7 p.m. Tuesday, Sally's tropical storm-force wind field was 49,087 square miles..

That's a little larger than the state of Mississippi..

How climate change may be making Hurricane Sally worse.

(CNN) Scientists believe global warming is influencing hurricanes and making their impacts worse..

And Hurricane Sally looks to be checking all their boxes..

Here's how:  It rapidly intensified  Sally saw top winds increase from 60 to 100 mph in 12 hours, from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday..

JUST WATCHED What 'rapid intensification' means for storms Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What 'rapid intensification' means for storms 01:10  Rapid intensification is one way scientists believe th.

Hurricanes Hanna and Laura earlier this year also rapidly intensified before making landfall in Texas and Louisiana, respectively..

Rapid intensification is especially dangerous when in happens in the 24 to 48 hours before a storm reaches land..

That's because you can go to bed at night anticipating a Category 1, then wake up to a Category 3 major hurricane that brings impacts far worse than earlier anticipated..

And that is exactly what we've seen with Sally, Laura and Hanna..

It's creeping toward land  Sally is moving at 2 mph -- slower than the average human walking pace..

Hurricanes and tropical storms are moving slower around the planet, says a study from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist James Kossin, who analyzed hundreds of storms in all bas.

The slower a storm moves, the more rain it can drop on a particular area, and the longer severe winds have to weaken infrastructure..

There was a 10% decrease globally in storms' forward speed between 1949 and 2016, though there was some variation among ocean basins, the 2018 study in the scientific journal Nature showed..

Recent storms that have devastated the US -- such as Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas -- have moved extremely slow, allowing for massive rainfall totals and flooding..

It's packing a lot of rain  Historic flooding is possible with Sally, the National Hurricane Center said, because of the amount of rain that is forecast over 48 hours beginning Tuesday..

Scientists are very confident the climate crisis is making storm rainfall worse by increasing the rate at which it falls, as well as the amount of rain a storm can produce..

A woman is evacuated by canoe in Houston after Hurricane Harvey dumped record rainfall in 2017..

"Simply put, warmer air holds more water vapor," said Kossin, an atmospheric research scientist at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information..

Gulf of Mexico water temperatures are largely above average, and the Northern Hemisphere just experienced its hottest summer on record ..

That allows storms like Sally to hold more moisture and produce more rain..

With Sally, three to four months' worth of rain could fall before the storm leaves the region Thursday..

‘Huge rainmaker’: Hurricane Sally threatens historic floods.

NAVARRE BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Heavy rain, pounding surf and flash floods hit parts of the Florida Panhandle and the Alabama coast on Tuesday as Hurricane Sally lumbered toward land at a painfully slow pa.

The storm’s center churned offshore 65 miles (105 kilometers) south-southeast of Mobile, Alabama, as Sally crept north-northeast toward an expected Wednesday landfall at 2 mph (3 kph), according to th.

The forecast map showed the center likely coming ashore in Alabama, near the Florida line..

Hurricane force winds extended 40 miles (65 kilometers)..

Rain fell sideways and began covering roads in Pensacola, Florida, and Mobile..

More than 80,000 power customers were without electricity, according to poweroutage.us..

Up to a foot (more than 30 centimeters) of rain had fallen already on the coast by Tuesday night and Sally’s lumbering pace meant there would likely be extended deluges..

“A hurricane moving at 2 mph is stalled for all intents and purposes,” said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami..

“If they aren’t moving along and they just kind of sit there, you’re going to get a ridiculous amount of rain.”.

Sally strengthened late Tuesday, with sustained winds reaching 90 mph (145 kph)..

The National Hurricane Center expected Sally to remain a Category 1 hurricane when it comes ashore, adding “historic life-threatening flash flooding is likely.”.

By Tuesday night, hurricane warnings stretched from coastal Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle..

There also was a threat the storm could spawn tornadoes and dump isolated rain accumulations of 30 inches (76 centimeters) in spots from the Florida Panhandle to southeast Mississippi..

Heavy rain and surf pounded the barrier island of Navarre Beach, Florida, on Tuesday and road signs wobbled in the wind..

Rebecca Studstill, who lives inland, was wary of getting stuck on the island, saying police close bridges once the wind and water get too high..

“Just hunkering down would probably be the best thing for folks out here,” she said..

Two large casino boats broke loose Tuesday from a dock where they were undergoing construction work in Bayou La Batre, Alabama..

M.J. Bosarge, who lives near the shipyard, said at least one of the riverboats had done considerable damage to the dock..

“You really want to get them secured because with wind and rain like this, the water is constantly rising,” Bosarge said..

In Orange Beach, Alabama, towering waves crashed onshore as Crystal Smith and her young daughter, Taylor, watched before nightfall..

They drove more than an hour to take in the sight..

“It’s beautiful, I love it,” Crystal Smith said amid whipping wind..

Capt. Michael Thomas, an Orange Beach fishing guide, secured boats and made other last-minute preparations..

He estimated up to 5 inches (13 centimeters) of rain had fallen in as many hours..

Stacy Stewart, a hurricane center senior specialist, warned that floods could be deadly..

Forecasters warned that Sally could unleash flooding similar to what Hurricane Harvey inflicted in 2017 in swamping the Houston metropolitan area..

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves urged people in the southern part of the state to prepare for the potential for flash flooding..

He said about 120 people were in shelters in Mississippi..

As rain grew heavier Tuesday, many businesses appeared to be closed at exits along the Interstate 10 highway running along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Florida..

In Gulfport, Mississippi, white plastic bags hung over some gas station pumps that were out of fuel..

Along a bayou inland from the Gulf, three shrimp boats were tied up as shrimpers tried to protect their boats from waves..

Metal storm shutters or plywood covered the windows of many businesses..

Revised forecasts late Tuesday predicted that storm surge along Alabama’s coast could reach 6 feet (1.8 meters) at Dauphin Island and as much as 4 feet (1.2 meters) at Mobile Bay..

Once ashore, Sally was forecast to cause flash floods and minor to moderate river flooding across inland portions of Mississippi, Alabama, northern Georgia and the western Carolinas over ensuing days..

On the barrier island of Pensacola Beach, Florida, the Sandshaker Lounge was open Tuesday afternoon, filled with about 30 locals and tourists staying at nearby hotels..

“I think I’m the only business open,” said bartender Kyra Smith..

She said most locals have lived in the area for decades and have weathered many storms bigger than Sally..

By ALEC ETHEREDGE | Managing Editor  As Hurricane Sally pounds the the Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana Gulf Coast as a category 2 storm, it will soon take a curve to the northeast where the slow-mo.

Sally is expected to make landfall early Wednesday morning, but is only moving at approximately 10 mph..

With that slow movement, the hurricane isn’t expected to make much movement during the next 24 hours, with the center going from just off shore on Tuesday morning to right around the Mobile area late .

But by Thursday around 1 p.m., the storm will start to move more toward south-central Alabama, which will lead to the locally-heavy rainfall..

The good news in Shelby County is that the path originally had the center coming through central Alabama, but it has now taken a more eastward turn with the center staying closer to Montgomery..

That puts the county on the less dangerous side of the storm as it starts to weaken on land, but the rainfall is still expected to be heavy at times between Wednesday and Friday mornings with clearing.

The National Weather Service out of Birmingham predicts the possibility of 4-6 inches of rain for the majority of Shelby County during that timespan with heavy bands of rain coming through..

But there currently isn’t a threat of severe weather with the focus being on flooding with a flash flood watch issued for counties along Interstate 59/20 and south..

Parts of the Gulf Coast, including the Mobile and Gulf Shores area could get between 15 and 30 inches of rain as the category-2 storm makes landfall..

The storm will weaken quickly from hurricane to tropical storm to tropical depression once it makes landfall, which will diminish the wind threat..

The rain threat, however, will remain high throughout the next 48 hours..

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey has issued a State of Emergency due to the storm and the state has also been approved for an Emergency Disaster Declaration..

On the backside of the storm, a cold front will move through almost simultaneously with highs expected to be in the mid 70s and lows in the 50s and 60s for the next week..

Construction barge breaks loose, strikes Three Mile Bridge during Hurricane Sally.

Brad Baker, the emergency management director for Santa Rosa County, said the barge is currently being held in place by a tow boat so it doesn't break loose again and do any more potential damage..

There's no exact timeline for when crews might be able to safely inspect the potential damage, but it could be until Thursday, Baker said..

'More people keep coming': Shelters open as rain pounds Escambia, Santa Rosa.

The Pensacola Bay Center was sheltering 90 people mid-morning Tuesday as the Panhandle braced for historic flooding from Hurricane Sally..

A total of 23 people sheltered in the center overnight Monday into Tuesday, and that number grew to 90 by mid-morning, according to Cyndee Pennington, general manager of the Bay Center..

"They have steadily continued to come in," she said..

Escambia County Emergency Manager Eric Gilmore said at a morning press conference that the county has enough volunteers to staff the shelter, as well as officials from the health department..

"We've got plenty of space available," Gilmore said..

Officials on Monday evening called for a voluntary evacuation for the lowest-lying areas of the county, including Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key, and they are preparing to see more people seeking she.

"We are concerned about the rain," Gilmore said at the 10 a.m. press conference..

"We did receive new rain values that could potentially have isolated rain values for the next 24 to 36 hours of up to 30 inches..

So because of those rain values, we have requested six additional high-water vehicles from the state of Florida that will be sent in this morning..

"  The Escambia County Sheriff's Office also has two high-water rescue vehicles, and Sheriff David Morgan said people should exercise common sense to stay safe during the storm.  ".

We have not seen the worst of this storm," Morgan said. ".

And so for you to practice just you know basic common sense is going to help us help you get through this impending storm..

"  Chief Deputy Chip Simmons said the Sheriff's Office will respond to calls as long as the weather allows.  ".

While this may well be more of a rain event for us, there will be standing water and we encourage you to not get out and sight-see," Simmons said..

All those taking shelter in the Bay Center must first pass through a COVID-19 screening before entering, being given a blanket and making their way to the facility's second floor to claim a place to s.

"They have us on the floor," said Benson Brown II..

"They give you a hazard blanket and give you a spot of the floor.".

Brown's friend, Randy Moultrie, chimed in, saying, "There aren't any cots.".

Both Moultrie and Brown said they are residents of the Waterfront Rescue Mission, which bused around 30 of its residents to the Bay Center Tuesday morning as a precaution..

"They said it might flood over there," Brown said..

Standing about 15 feet away from the two friends, Richard Fox leaned against one of the Bay Center's large columns..

Fox said he was homeless and had seen quite a few bad storms in his time..

He was discharged Monday from Baptist Hospital when he learned of Sally's approach..

Slow-moving Hurricane Sally threatens northern Gulf Coast, with ‘historic’ flooding forecast.

Hurricane Sally was crawling toward the Alabama and Mississippi coastline on Tuesday evening, packing excessive to extreme rainfall..

Flooding, both coastal and freshwater, will be the most widespread and dangerous hazard associated with this storm..

The National Weather Service was warning that “historic life-threatening flash flooding is likely” as Sally’s worst rains arrive..

All that excess water will pour into area rivers, many of which are likely to reach moderate to major flood stage even after the rains begin to taper down Wednesday night..

Hardest hit will probably be parts of southern Alabama and the adjacent Florida Panhandle, where at least a dozen rivers are expected to crest at moderate or major flood stage..

Record crests are possible based on current forecast trends..

Among them is the Bayou Sara at Saraland on the northwest side of Mobile Bay..

At that level, the National Weather Service warns, “numerous houses and streets flood east of the [railroad] between Bayou Sara and Norton Creek.”.

The Styx River in Elsanor, Ala., east of Mobile, was forecast to crest at 27.5 feet on Wednesday afternoon, more than 10 feet above major flood stage..

That would mark the river’s second-highest crest on record..

At 21 feet, “major flooding occurs to houses and streets along the river in Seminole Landing” along the Alabama-Florida border, the National Weather Service wrote..

Flooding is also likely near Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle, where the Shoal River near Crestview on the northern edge of the base could peak four feet above major flood stage..

UPDATE: 54% of Escambia County without power due to Sally. See Florida power outage map.

Gulf Power officials say the 95% of Escambia and Santa Rosa County households that can accept power will be fully restored by the end of the night Tuesday..

Okaloosa County customers will essentially be restored by late Friday evening, a  Thousands of Florida households remain without power after Hurricane Sally made landfall Wednesday morning..

Residents in Escambia County and Santa Rosa County were by far the hardest hit by the outages caused by now Tropical Depression Sally, according to Gulf Power..

As of 9:30 p.m. Friday, roughly 54% of all Gulf Power customers in Escambia County were without power, with a total of 82,510 confirmed outages in the county..

In Santa Rosa County, about 18,340 Gulf Power customers — or roughly 25% of people — did not have power as of 9:30 p.m. Friday..

Updated: Ware Mechanical Weather alert: Soggy Sally triggers flash flood watch for our area Wednesday afternoon through Friday morning. At least 4 to 6 inches of rain possible..

From the National Weather Service in Peachtree City: What we can expect from Hurricane Sally’s remnants, starting Wednesday..

At least 4 to 6 inches in Northwest Georgia so flooding should be an issue..

Wet ground, strong gusts means a greater potential for power outages..

Flash flood watch in effect from 2 p.m. Wednesday through 8 a.m. Friday..

The National Weather Service in Peachtree City has issued a * Flash Flood Watch for the majority of north and central Georgia, except for far northwest Georgia and southeast central Georgia..

* From Wednesday afternoon through Friday morning * Periods of heavy rainfall are expected across the area with the outer rain bands of Hurricane Sally as it tracks inland west of the area Wednesday a.

Associated rainfall totals in excess of 3 to 4 inches and areas of 5 to 6 inches are expected with even locally higher amounts possible..

The highest amounts look to be in a swath centered along the I-85 corridor, though this could shift with future forecast updates..

* Soils are expected to become quickly saturated and runoff from heavy rain will lead to a threat of flash flooding..

Some of the rivers, small creeks, and streams could also respond with flooding that may linger beyond the watch period..

OUTLOOK  Northwest Georgia could see as much as four inches of rain between late Wednesday and midday Friday, according to long-range projects..

SYNOPSIS... As Hurricane Sally moves inland and weakens somewhere across southern Alabama, multiple rounds of heavy rain will be possible across north and central Georgia, especially Wednesday night t.

With some model uncertainty remaining with respect to track and intensity of Sally, changes to the forecast rainfall totals can be expected with future forecast packages, and may include slightly high.

RAINFALL EXPECTED... At this time, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected across a wide area of north and central Georgia, with locally higher amounts of 6 to 8 inches possible..

With the forecast track and movement somewhat uncertain as the tropical system moves inland, it is difficult to pinpoint where the highest totals will end up..

However, based on the latest forecast information, it appears the heaviest rain is likely to occur on either side of the I-85 corridor..

FORECAST  Tuesday: A 30 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms, mainly after 2pm..

East wind 5 to 10 mph, with gusts as high as 15 mph..

Tuesday Night: A slight chance of showers and thunderstorms..

Hurricane Sally: Major rivers in Escambia, Santa Rosa expected to near record flood levels.

In fact, the National Weather Service predicts rainfall from Hurricane Sally will flood all major rivers in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in the coming days..

The Blackwater River had already risen high enough by 2 p.m. Tuesday to spill over the boardwalk that is part of Santa Rosa County Veteran's Memorial Park in downtown Milton..

Santa Rosa County spokeswoman Brandi Bates told the News Journal that her office had been sending alerts for several days in advance of the storm, warning residents with homes near the Blackwater Rive.

"One thing about this type of flooding — and I don’t want to say this in a good way, as if the flooding is a good thing — but it’s helpful that you can see it coming..

We are able to tell people, 'You need to prepare for this,'" Bates said on Tuesday. ".

Flash flooding that happens on roads is different..

But we know in advance that there are going to be issues..

So we’ve been putting messages out for a couple of days now and we’ll send another one tonight..

"  If you see an overflowing river, it is best to stay a safe distance away from the swollen waters..

“One thing that we have really been thinking about is that we don’t want people going to bed Wednesday or Thursday night thinking everything is fine and wake up and there is water in their house,” Bat.

“So, we are really trying to warn people in advance and make sure that people include their pets in their plans.”.

Predicting river crest levels  The National Weather Service's Southeast River Forecast Center predicted that the Blackwater River would reach "flood stage" Tuesday evening when it was projected to rea.

The Blackwater is projected to reach its highest crest after 5 p.m. Wednesday with a depth of 25.2 feet..

The highest crest ever recorded for the Blackwater occurred on Sept. 29, 1998, when it crested at 25.68 feet , according to the NWS..

The Coldwater Creek, which flows into the Blackwater River northeast of Milton, was also projected to reach a flood state Tuesday evening and to continue to rise until as late as 5 p.m. Thursday..

Story continues below interactive graphic  Forecasts for Escambia County  In Escambia County, the Florida Division of Emergency Management has forecast record flooding on the Escambia River near Centu.

The FDEM has issued a river flood warning for the Perdido River..

The warning stated that the river is expected to crest at 26 feet around 5 p.m. Wednesday with flooding similar that caused by Hurricane Georges in 1998..

By Tuesday, the Perdido River had already flooded River Annex Road, Ruby's Fish Camp, Hurst Hammock Road, Seminole Landing, Adventures Perdido River, and River Bend Estates are flooded, according to t.

If the Perdido River reaches 24 feet, the water is projected to enter the first floor of houses on stilts just north of Adventures Perdido River, the alert stated..

Hurricane Sally batters the Central Gulf Coast hours away from landfall.

BRYAN, Texas (KBTX) - Hurricane Sally has been crawling closer to the north-central Gulf Tuesday..

Sally’s forward speed as of the 4PM update from the National Hurricane Center was only 2 mph..

This means the center of the circulation continues to remain offshore allowing for this storm to maintain its strength and push in not only storm surge but also very heavy rainfall to portions of the .

11pm Update:  As of the hour, Hurricane Hunters have found that Sally has strengthened once again as it crawls toward the coast..

The center of the storm has cleared out and a small, visible eye can be seen on satellite..

Here are the stats as of 11pm:  Maximum sustained winds: 90 mph  Movement: north-northeast at 2 mph  Location of the center: 65 miles south-southeast of Mobile, Alabama / 60 miles southwest of Pensaco.

The present forecast calls for landfall as a strong Category 1 storms Wednesday morning near the Alabama / Florida state line, with a sustained maximum wind of 90mph..

Another point to note tonight, the forecast cone has shifted a bit more to the right, as of the 10pm update..

That places the center of Sally more over the far western tip of the Florida Panhandle before moving through Southeast Alabama slowly through the day Wednesday..

4 to 6 feet of storm surge is possible as Sally makes landfall Wednesday morning, right around the same time as high tide..

Rainfall could collect between 10 and 25 inches along the Gulf Coast..

5 to 15 inches of rain is possible across Southeast Alabama and portions of Georgia over the next 24 to 48 hours..

As of 4pm:  Maximum sustained winds: 80 mph  Movement: North at 2 mph  Location of the center: 85 miles south of Mobile, Alabama  Pressure: 979 mb  The reason for the slow forward speed of this system.

High pressure over the Gulf of Mexico keeps the jet stream parked well to the north, and the high pressure system does not have a strong influence to scoop Sally up and away from the Gulf coast..

This high pressure system also helps to keep the wind shear down which allows Sally to maintain its strength as it approaches landfall..

Sally is expected to make landfall Wednesday morning as a Category 1 hurricane..

(KBTX)  Landfall is forecast to happen sometime Wednesday morning but with little in the way of forward motion, it may take over 24 hours for this storm to move 160 miles..

This keeps the impacts of onshore push of water along the coastal regions and very heavy rainfall in the forecast for the southeast along with tropical storm-force winds..

Excessive Rainfall Outlooks show the probability that flash flooding thresholds will be met due to heavy rainfall..

(KBTX)  Excessive Rainfall Outlooks show the probability that flash flooding thresholds will be met due to heavy rainfall..

(KBTX)  By Thursday afternoon, a little help from an area of low pressure that will bring a cold front through the Brazos Valley will shift eastward to finally kick this storm out of the Gulf coastal .

As this happens, it is expected to lose tropical characteristics and become an remnant low Friday afternoon over South Carolina..

An upper-level low pressure system that impacts Texas Thursday will help nudge Sally eastward by the end of the week..

Sally's two biggest threats are inland flooding and storm surge.

(CNN) Hurricane Sally could possibly cause historic flooding "with extreme life-threatening flash flooding likely through Wednesday," the National Hurricane Center says..

Hurricanes are commonly thought of as strong, powerful winds..

But it's actually the water that causes most of the destruction, accounting for nearly 90% of fatalities..

Hurricane #Sally is likely to produce extreme life-threatening flash flooding through Wed along and just inland of the central Gulf Coast from the western Florida Panhandle to far southeastern Mississ.

@NWSWPC expects 10-20" of rain, isolated 30"- historic flooding possible..

pic.twitter.com/RPHVT0LR4F — National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) September 15, 2020  Ten to 20 inches of rain are expected along the Gulf Coast, with Isolated higher totals of 30 inches possible.

Atlanta, Birmingham, Charlotte, and even Greenville, South Carolina, all at least 200 miles from the coast, will see significant amounts of rain that could trigger flooding..

Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, will both see 4-6 inches of rain through Friday..

Birmingham and Greenville, South Carolina, are both forecast to pick up 6-10 inches through Friday..

Mississippi officials give latest on Hurricane Sally.

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Governor Tate Reeves and MEMA officials gave an update on Hurricane Sally Tuesday afternoon..

The storm continues to move east away from Mississippi, but the Gulf Coast remains a concern, with storm surge and heavy rain likely to cause flooding..

The Category 1 storm is expected to make landfall some time overnight..

Reeves said that Sally is moving at 2 miles per hour and has been difficult to predict..

“There is still a lot of uncertainty with this particular storm,” Reeves stated..

“We do expect, at this time, that it will hit landfall somewhere around the east of the Mississippi/Alabama line, perhaps even in the Mobile Bay area.”.

He said that with it coming at 9 a.m. Wednesday morning, the good news is that it will hit during daylight hours but the bad news is it will be during high tide..

He said the possibility for a water event on the coast is “significant.”.

Reeves said that the eye of the hurricane has also had a difficult time forming and, due to that, its predictability has been “very, very low.”.

It is predicated, though, that Jackson County will see over fifteen inches of rain during the storm and ten inches in George County..

Reeves said that it would not surprise him if Sally shifted west and hit anywhere from the east of Biloxi..

Hurricane Sally: Florida National Guard deploys to Panhandle to help with recovery.

Florida is deploying 125 National Guard troops to Northwest Florida to assist in recovery efforts from Hurricane Sally, according to state Sen. Doug Broxson..

Speaking at a press conference Tuesday afternoon at the Escambia County Emergency Operations Center, Broxson said he had spoken with the Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Jared Moskowi.

"He's sending over 125 National Guard and whatever resources we need," Broxson said..

Broxson said the state has also requested that President Donald Trump add Florida to his emergency declaration for the disaster..

Trump has already issued emergency declarations for the storm in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana..

Hurricane Sally was forecast to make landfall closer to Mississippi and Louisiana up until Monday, when the storm stalled out over the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the track shifted east..

At least two barges came loose from their moorings Tuesday morning as the waters in Pensacola Bay began to rise, Broxson said..

Some of the equipment on one the barges struck the new bridge, damaging some of the concrete structure, Broxson said..

An inspection of the bridge will have to be conducted before the bridge can reopen, which will not happen until the storm passes..

"The equipment on there bumped the top of the bridge, causing some concrete to drop..

They will have a team coming over," Broxson said. ".

Unfortunately, they cannot use their equipment they normally use to drop the engineers down to the site of the damage..

They'll have to do it by vessel, and that will not be until the wind and the water subside..

"  Broxson said the contractor, Skanska, believes there was "minimal damage" to the bridge, but an inspection will have to confirm it.  ".

The good news is that we have one of the largest contractors in the world that has over $100 million of equipment that can immediately get on any problem that should be there if there's an issue," Bro.

And the inconvenience to the public going from Gulf Breeze to Pensacola would be short-lived, hopefully..

"  Officials are expecting conditions to get worse overnight as Hurricane Sally slow moves toward Mobile Bay, where it is current expected to make landfall.  ".

Hopefully, you're done with anything you need to do that's a necessity," Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan said. ".

Hurricane Sally's largest impact in south and west Alabama will come in the form of "life threatening and likely historic flooding," weather forecasts are predicting, as already wet ground in rural ar.

On Tuesday, weather and emergency management officials were expecting Sally to make landfall as a Category 1 hurricane sometime Wednesday morning to afternoon in an area between Gulfport, Mississippi,.

Landfall is currently projected near Mobile, said Jim Stefkovich, meteorologist for the Alabama Emergency Management Agency..

The storm is "extremely" slow moving, which makes accurate predictions of where it will come ashore difficult, he said..

Once inland the storm is expected to dump as much as 30 inches of rain in some places..

Rainfall total predictions from National Weather Service  15-20 inches for Mobile, Gulf Shores and Brewton;  10-15 inches for Andalusia;  8-10 inches for Grove Hill and Camden;  2-3 inches for Selma; .

Alabama Power crews responded recently to the recovery effort in Louisiana and Texas in the wake of Hurricane Laura..

Those crews returned to the state this past weekend, Jordan said..

Caution should be exercised if portable generators are used during power outages..

There were 15 fatalities attributed to Hurricane Laura in Louisiana, with eight of those deaths coming from carbon monoxide poisoning from improper use of a generator, according to the Louisiana Depar.

Exhaust fumes from generators contain carbon monoxide, an odorless, tasteless gas that is deadly..

"Generators are great to have as an auxiliary power source," said Ernie Baggett, director of the Autauga County Emergency Management Agency..

"But they should never be used in a confined space, like to home or garage..

That would allow the carbon monoxide fumes to get into the dwelling and pose a serious risk..

"All generators need to be far away from the home while they are in use..

And you need to make sure the exhaust fumes can't get into the house of building through open windows or the air nonconducting system..

Hurricane Sally will bring heavy rain to Middle Georgia this week - 41NBC News.

Hurricane Sally has been sitting off the Gulf Coast this afternoon and evening bringing heavy rain to the area..

Many spots in the northern Gulf have already seen over 10″ of rain with more expected as the system moves at 2 mph (!!!).

By tomorrow afternoon Sally is forecast to make landfall and finally speed up its movement..

Sally moves north and east we will see the threat for heavy rain increase, as well as the very small chance of a spin-up tornado..

We will see the potential heavy rain continue through Thursday morning (and maybe the afternoon) before Sally finally begins to fall apart and get swept out to sea with a cold front..

Generally, the heaviest rain is expected just north of our area, but any shift in track could bring flooding rains to Middle GA..

A Flash Flood Watch has been issued for parts of Middle Georgia until Friday morning..

The isolated tornado threat should be contained to areas mainly south of Macon..

This is a very small chance of severe weather, but spin-up tornadoes are definitely a risk with tropical systems..

Wind gusts are going to be a pretty minor threat for Middle Georgia, but we can’t rule out a 30-35 mph wind gust as the main system works its way through..

A cold front is on the way for the weekend and it will bring sunshine, cooler temps, and much drier air!.

All just in time for the first day of fall on Tuesday..

'Life-threatening' storm surge, 'historic' flash flooding. What Hurricane Sally means for Alabama.

Water sustains life, but in large enough quantities it can sweep cars off the roads, wash away homes and even take away life..

When Hurricane Sally makes landfall, the storm will bring with it a lot of water, dumping upwards of 10 to 20 inches with isolated amounts of 30 inches along Alabama's coastline..

Further inland, central Alabama could see 4 to 8 inches with upwards of 12 inches in isolated areas..

The storm surge levels are predicted to reach a "life-threatening" level..

Early storm surge in Coden on Tuesday shoved a casino boat onto the dock after it broke free, according to the National Weather Service in Mobile..

Inland, communities could very likely see "historic life-threatening flash flooding," according to the National Hurricane Center, and swollen rivers sweeping cars off roadways and inundating residenti.

The impact to Alabama's already saturated earth has the potential to be catastrophic in areas..

Sally’s storm surge and rainfall are forecast to cause extensive flooding in southern Alabama but may fall just below records set by previous hurricanes in the region, including Georges, Gustav, Katri.

More:As Hurricane Sally nears Alabama, Gulf Shores and Dauphin Island webcams show live conditions  A storm surge of 4 to 7 feet above dry ground is forecast by the National Weather Service along the .

That’s enough to cause structural damage to buildings but it’s below the surge Hurricane Katrina battered the areas with when it made landfall to the west in August 2005, near the Mississippi/Louisian.

By early Tuesday a spotter had reported Highway 163 was flooded at Dockside Marina in Sunny Cove, Alabama..

Sally’s lingering rainfall and flooding is forecast to wreak major havoc along coastal Alabama and the far western Florida Panhandle with as much as 25 to 30 inches of rain in isolated locations..

The weather service continues to add Alabama waterways to its list of flood warnings, including the Alabama River at Millers Ferry Dam and the Claiborne Dam..

Flash flooding is of great concern for the Southeast River Forecast Center, which monitors river levels..

"They come really quickly and without notice," Taiye Sangoyomi, with the center, said..

"It may also take a while for the rivers to recede from these flood effects.".

More:Hurricane Sally: Erosion a top concern for those on Alabama's Dauphin Island  Monitors on several coastal Alabama waterways have already predicted major flooding, which can lead to extensive inun.

Several south and central Alabama waterways are predicted to reach moderate flood levels in the days after Sally makes landfall..

One inch of rain falling on one acre is about 27,154 gallons and weighs 113 tons, according to the USGS..

Per square mile, an inch of rain equals 17.4 million gallons of water, so 25 inches of rain would mean 435 million gallons of rain per square mile..

Gov. Kay Ivey:Hurricane Sally could break flooding records  With each gallon of water weighing more than 8 pounds, it’s difficult for many people to imagine the force of that kind of flood or the havo.

The rainfall is likely to reach historic levels, the weather service has said, but not quite the records set by Danny in 1997..

During Danny, at total of 36.71 inches of rain fell at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab, including 25.98 inches between 5 p.m. and midnight on Dauphin Island, the weather service said..

Across the rest of the area, Danny dropped 43 inches of rain over Mobile Bay, 30 inches in Gulf Shores and 13.04 inches at Mobile Regional Airport..

Southeast of Mobile, the Fish River is forecast to reach 21.8 feet on Wednesday, its third highest crest since records began before December 1953..

The record was set at 23.06 feet in April 2014 after a flash flood upstream..

When the river reaches 11 feet, the bridge floods at County Road 48, water begins flowing into homes on Keeny Road at 15.6 feet and into homes on honey road at 16.6 feet..

From there it begins to flow into other subdivisions and floods County Road 54 at 21 feet..

At Bayou Sara at Saraland, southeast of Mobile, water levels are forecast to rise as high as 8.5 feet on Wednesday..

That’s more than a foot below the record height of 9.8 feet set on Sept. 28, 1998, when Hurricane Georges made landfall near Biloxi..

It would be the bayou’s third highest level since records began before 1975..

The water reached 9.3 feet the day Hurricane Gustav made landfall on Sept. 1, 2008..

When the water reaches 5 feet, street flooding is widespread east of the railroad, and when it reaches 7.5 feet, some evacuations become necessary, according to the National Weather Service..

At 8.3 feet, the water would flood numerous streets and houses between the bayou and Norton’s Creek..

Katrina’s storm surge flooded a broad swath of the Gulf Coast, from New Orleans to Pensacola, including locations along the Alabama coast and around Mobile Bay..

The surge, topped by large waves reached as high as 15 feet in Mobile during Katrina, according to a summary from the U.S. Geological Survey..

Flood elevations on Dauphin Island and West Beach reached between 8.5 feet and 11 feet, the USGS said..

The surging Gulf destroyed many homes, cut a breach through the island and caused major erosion..

Katrina also flooded the communities of Fowl River and Coden on the northwestern side of Mobile Bay, with the USGS measuring flood elevations after the storm of 11 to 15 feet..

On the southwestern shore of Mobile Bay, flood elevations reached 8 to 9 feet..

Farther to to the north and east, the Bay reached more than 13 feet at Fairhope, but the area was partially protected by a bluff along that northern shoreline..

Heavy rain expected in Volusia, Flagler, but it's not directly related to Hurricane Sally, forecasters say.

Although it's hundreds of miles away, the high moisture in the air because of Hurricane Sally loitering in the Gulf of Mexico will lead to a rainy week in Volusia and Flagler counties, the National We.

Upcoming rain bands won't be directly related to Sally..

But meteorologist Derrick Weitlich said east Florida should still expect heavier-than-normal-rainfall — in addition to the several inches the area has received in the last week..

Roughly 840 gallons of wastewater were spilled at the Deltona Lakes wastewater treatment plant Monday because a seam in the tank with four small leaks was breached..

Water levels rose to "a level that is not typically seen," according to a Department of Environmental Protection public notice of pollution..

The breach occurred after almost 4 inches of rain fell in a single hour..

Weitlich confirmed the numbers, and said some areas in Deltona received more than 6 inches of rain on Monday..

Other areas in Volusia County, such as DeLand and Lake Helen, received around 1.5 inches..

The City of Deltona closed the Lake Gleason boat ramp because of high water levels from the rain, according to a news  "For the rest of the week, we could easily get up to another inch of rainfall..

But locally heavy rainfall is certainly possible, especially inland,” Weitlich said..

Maybe not up to 6 inches, but it could get to 3 to 4 inches at times..

Rain chances in the area will rise to around 60% on Wednesday and remain high for the rest of the week..

As of Tuesday afternoon, there was also a flood warning for the St. Johns river near Astor..

The rain is impacting Volusia and Lake counties, Weitlich said, and minor flooding is forecast..

"The Saint Johns River at Astor is presently at Flood Stage," a hazardous weather outlook from the weather service said..

"While levels are forecast to remain relatively steady, any additional heavy rainfall may increase levels through mid to late week..

Astronomical high tides are also likely impeding water flow..

Hurricane Sally: What Alabama schools have closed because of the storm.

As Hurricane Sally approaches landfall, Alabama school districts have started to close their doors ahead of what emergency experts warn could be a historic flooding event..

On Tuesday, nine districts and a charter school, primarily in the southern portions of the state, were closed, with Houston County Schools announcing an early dismissal at 1 p.m..

For Wednesday, nearly two dozen districts and two charter schools have announced closures..

Closed school districts in Alabama include:  ACCEL Day and Evening Academy  Autauga County  Baldwin County Schools  Bibb County  Brewton City  Butler County  Chilton County  Chickasaw City  Clarke Cou.

Hurricane Sally is recorded 105 miles south-southeast of Biloxi, Mississippi with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph..

On the forecast track, the center of Sally will move near the coast of southeastern Louisiana later on Tuesday, and make landfall in the hurricane warning area tonight or Wednesday morning..

During a Tuesday morning press conference, Gov. Kay Ivey urged Alabama's Gulf Coast and "flood-prone" residents to evacuate if possible..

More:Gov. Kay Ivey on Hurricane Sally: Alabamians in low-lying areas need to evacuate  "We are looking at record flooding, perhaps breaking historic levels," Ivey said in the conference..

"Rising water comes with great risk for loss of property and life..

... I urge you in the strongest way possible to evacuate and seek shelter as this storm makes landfall tonight..

"  More districts could announce closures as Sally's impact moves north into the state..

National Weather Service's John De Block warned Tuesday that Alabama could see dangerous flooding further inland..

"We can see upwards of 8 to 10 inches of rain approaching the Montgomery area, which is going to lead us to a threat for flash flooding and also river flooding along the Alabama and Tallapoosa rivers,.

Alabama Emergency Management Agency Director Brian Hastings also urged people at risk of flash flooding to evacuate now if conditions permit..

"If you are in a low-lying area or a flood-prone area, get to a safer place and higher ground now," Hastings said..

Hurricane Sally sits in the Gulf, but along the coast deadly flood waters are rising..

10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight Forecasters tagged slow-moving Sally as an unusual type, a “walking storm,” because it lumbered at just 2 mph, about as fast as a lazy s.

The lack of speed bought time for residents in low-lying St. Charles Parish, La.; Mobile County, Ala.; Harrison County, Miss.; and Escambia, Fla., to leave their homes..

But it meant as much as 30 inches of rain could fall along the coasts of those states and up to five feet of storm surge could inundate coastal communities..

Forecasters said there could be record flooding along rivers in Northwest Florida, parts of Alabama and perhaps Georgia..

Advertisement  “The slow forward speed is likely to result in a historical rainfall event for the north-central Gulf Coast,” the National Hurricane Center posted in an online discussion about the stor.

Sally’s wobbly movement also makes it hard to predict where it will strike land..

On Monday, meteorologists predicted it would hit Biloxi, Miss., but that changed Tuesday and Mayor Andrew “FoFo” Gilich was relieved..

“We’re real thankful that we were spared the storm surge,” Gilich said..

But in Mobile, Ala., County Commissioner Merceria Ludgood watched with dread as predictions pointed their way..

“We’re telling people that there’s going to be a lot of water,” Ludgood said from an emergency management facility where she and other officials planned to ride out the storm..

It is also adorned with rivers, canals and the enormous Big Creek Lake that is prone to flooding, said Mike Evans, deputy director of the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency..

Evans said the county has been divided into evacuation zones..

Residents south of Interstate 10 as well as those east of Interstate 65 in Mobile Bay and the network of rivers that feed it should get out, he said..

The county sheriff commissioned a 15-ton military grade vehicle to respond if residents who decide to hunker down are trapped..

When the hurricane hits, public officials, emergency personnel included, planned to shelter in place..

Emergency officials gently asked Mobile County residents to impose on friends and family inland to put them up for a while..

Theodore High School, where the county established a shelter, can usually hold up to a thousand evacuees..

But social distancing as a result of the coronavirus pandemic has limited occupation to only 300..

Downtown Mobile was mostly empty Tuesday, with businesses in the flood-prone area closed in advance of Hurricane Sally..

Signs of a hurricane’s approach were a common sight: boarded windows, sandbagged doors and streets barricaded in places where water was expected to surge..

Advertisement  Hayley’s Bar was one of a few exceptions..

Doors were open and three customers enjoyed afternoon drinks..

“The city floods on like a normal rainy day,” said Grace Foster, 23..

Foster and the other patrons live within walking distance of Hayley’s..

“We are all stocked up for covid already, so we had a lot of the stuff we need,” said Tres Wiggins, 28..

“I just moved all my plants inside,” Foster said, “and we stocked up on alcohol.”.

Heading south toward Dauphin Island, Ala., Sally’s effects were more visible Tuesday, as floodwaters from Mobile Bay began spilling across roads..

Sonya Gunderson, 60, was having a ball at a retreat on the island, where she traveled from Iowa to meet seven friends who fished the ocean and frolicked on the beach..

Advertisement  But Sally chased them off the vulnerable strip of land into a condo in Mobile..

On Tuesday, she walked in a steady downpour downtown, wearing a blue raincoat and carrying a pan, a lighter and some candles — supplies borrowed from the property manager in advance of the storm’s imp.

At a popular fishing spot near Buccaneer Yacht Club, Robert Boykin, 62, sat with his wife in one of a dozen parked cars, looking out over the bay’s unusually choppy waters..

“I just hope it doesn’t get too bad, because I only stay a mile or two from here,” Boykin said..

For Boykin and others, Sally’s snail-paced approach made it hard to know just when to hunker down..

“But as soon as we get home, we’re going to be there.”.

Advertisement  In Biloxi, the city’s eight casinos were still temporarily shut after the storm turned east..

Since 2005, residents have compared major storms to Hurricane Katrina, which pummeled the city with 28 feet of storm surges that are still marked in blue paint on telephone poles..

“We got wiped off the face of the Earth,” said Karen Parrott, 63, as she took an afternoon stroll to the shore with her husband, Bill, also 63..

The couple said they were not worried about Hurricane Sally..

Across the Route 110 bridge that links Biloxi to the city of D’Iberville, Miss., a pair of friends chatted as the high tide covered picnic tables and seeped into the road..

They said they were not expecting much from Sally..

“It’s doubtful this late in the season,” said Joshua Jackson, 27, a construction worker from the community of Vancleave, Miss., who stopped to hang out under the bridge on his way home from work in Gu.

Michael Kimberl, director of the Alfred Washburn Center, which serves the homeless, spent much of the last 24 hours ferrying the homeless to the civic center..

“I’ve been driving shuttle most of the afternoon and last night trying to get people to shelters,” said Kimberl, who dropped off about 30 people there by 3 p.m. Tuesday..

Advertisement  Kimberl worried he wouldn’t be able to reach all of the area’s homeless before the storm made landfall and felt local authorities were partially to blame for waiting too long to announc.

The biggest issue will be storm surge along the extreme SE Louisiana coast..

Storm surge values within the tidal lakes of Maurepas and Pontchartrain has been decreased with the latest advisory from the National Hurricane Center..

Storm surge of 2-4 feet is currently forecast, but values within the WAFB viewing area (lower Livingston, Ascension, and Tangipahoa Parishes) will likely be on the order of 1-2 feet..

That will be manageable and likely less than what we saw from Hurricane Laura..

First Alert Forecast (WAFB)  Winds will stay breezy over the next few days as Sally slowly moves north and then farther away from the local area..

It is unlikely winds will be strong enough to cause problems locally..

Rainfall amounts will be manageable with most locations staying less than 0.10″ through Wednesday..

Rains will be confined to rain bands that can wrap around the circulation of Sally..

The district will continue to monitor the weather throughout the remainder of the week..

An official announce will come from the office of communications or district superintendent..

PANAMA CITY, Fla. (WJHG) - Good Tuesday morning everyone!.

All eyes remain on a slow moving Category 1 Hurricane Sally this morning with 85mph winds..

The system is still meandering northwest at 2mph, and is located about 140miles southwest of Panama City, 80 miles south of Mobile and 100 miles southeast of the Mississippi River delta in Louisiana..

A Tornado Watch has been issued for NWFL until 6pm CDT as an isolated tornado or two is possible to spin up in the bands of Sally moving through..

However, they’re anticipated to be brief and weak if we do see a few..

Meanwhile, steady and persistent rains continue over most of NWFL this morning..

It’s not too terribly heavy, but could be at times today..

Regardless of rainfall intensity, the persistent rain will continue for just about all of today and even continue into most of tomorrow as well..

That will lead toward minor flooding in flood prone areas, and the possibility of flash flooding in any heavy banding of rains..

Remember, if the road looks flooded, turn around and don’t drown!.

The heavy rains will continue to be our primary threat with Sally regardless of exact landfall which remains very difficult to determine..

Sally sits in weak steering flow right now at almost a stall in between a ridge of high pressure to its northeast and a developing trough to the northwest..

Because of the lack of steering flow, Sally is expected to generally drift northward today and tonight before turning to the northeast tomorrow as a trough moves in from the northwest..

The National Hurricane Center mentioned the difficulty in determining where landfall may occur due to the lack of steering flow in their discussion this morning noting, “It should be emphasized that i.

The new NHC track forecast is a little to the east of the previous one, trending toward the latest consensus aids.”.

That consensus is a bit more centered around an area from Biloxi, MS, to Mobile, AL..

However, forecast error and Sally’s cone still has a wide-birth with landfall possible anywhere from the Mississippi River Delta to the Florida/Alabama state line..

At this point, surge potential looks highest at 2-4ft from Destin to Pensacola, with 1-3ft for the rest of the Florida Panhandle to the east..

Winds may gust from the east to southeast to tropical storm strength along the coast, especially for areas west of Destin, with sustained winds around 15-25mph for the immediate coast down to 10-15mph.

Heavy rain and potential flooding rains of up to 5-10″ across the Panhandle from yesterday through Wednesday will continue to be the main threat with the higher amounts closer to the coast..

Bottom Line...  For today, rain likely throughout much if not all fo the day, new rainfall amounts may reach up to 2-3″ especially along the coast..

Your 7 Day Forecast has one more rainy and windy day ahead for tomorrow as we watch Sally make landfall along the Northern Gulf Coast..

SANTA ROSA BEACH, Fla. (WJHG/WECP) -  Heavy rain, flash floods, and strong wind gusts are some of the expected impacts from Hurricane Sally..

“We’re looking heavily at our roads to make sure our roads don’t flood, and our bridges,” said Walton County Commissioner Danny Glidewell..

Classes were canceled for Walton County students Monday, and school is canceled Tuesday as well..

“The superintendent made the decision based on information we gave him that it was not safe to be out on the routes because of the tropical storm force gusts, so they made the decision to close school.

Emergency Management officials are encouraging people to make sure they have their hurricane preparedness kits ready, but they say don’t panic..

“We have a tendency that if something blips off the coast of Africa, people kind of get a little upset about that, until we start looking at storm warnings and watches, stay calm, listen to the weathe.

Rain Batters Alabama Communities as Hurricane Sally Approaches.

Ms. Bosarge brought her older brother back to Bayou La Batre and her elevated home, set just a few yards from the water..

There had been a different house on the property before Hurricane Katrina, but Katrina blew it away, along with Ms. Bosarge’s wedding bands and family photos..

The Volunteers of America came through town and built her this new house..

Since Katrina, many houses in Bayou La Batre are now raised on stilts, and people have their ways of figuring out what to do with all that space below..

You can park a truck or boat, store junk or store tools..

Ms. Bosarge turned her place into a pleasant outdoor living room, with a little tiki bar, some porch swings and a stereo system..

And so here they were, brother and sister, hurricane survivors on their porch swings, watching this new slow-moving disaster unfold all around them..

They were in good enough spirits, and they planned on evacuating soon and riding out the storm with a relative on higher ground in Grand Bay..

Ms. Bosarge joked about how she had never learned to swim, and joked that Mr. Nelson was a bad-news hurricane magnet..

But the pair were serious about what has happened to their way of life, and the life of so many other Gulf people..

The storms were getting bigger and more intense, they said, and they both blamed climate change..

The storm will complicate efforts to contain the coronavirus..

The 223rd Engineer Battalion from West Point and the 890th Engineer Battalion of Gulfport sent personnel to Camp Shelby in Hattiesburg and National Guard Readiness Centers in Picayune, Pascagoula and .

“Responding to these events typically requires quick reaction, so it is important that personnel and equipment are always prepared and ready to deploy when needed," battalion commander Lt. Col. Thomas.

The ability for our soldiers to deploy with little or no lead time is a reflection of our soldiers' commitment and willingness to support their communities and state.”.

4:30 p.m.: Track could put landfall east of Mobile Bay  As of Tuesday afternoon, forecasters were predicting Hurricane Sally will make landfall east of Mobile Bay; further distancing it from Mississip.

That was good news for Blake Elkins of Ocean Springs as he watched storm surge creep toward his home..

"It looks like we got lucky being on the west side of it..

I was expecting to get, with 8 or 11 feet, I was expecting to get water all under my house..

I was expecting all the electrical under my house to get water and on the dock out there, too..

"  Elkins said a storm in recent years with less surge than was initially anticipated from Sally, 7 to 9 feet, put 1 1/2 feet of water under his home..

So, as a precaution he moved his vehicles to higher ground..

"Our cars would have been flooded and our golf car would have been flooded even with that much," Elkins said..

3:30 p.m.: Gov. Reeves says Sally 'hard to gauge'  Gov. Tate Reeves told the media Tuesday afternoon that the path of Hurricane Sally is not clear with its slow meander in the warm Gulf waters..

He said the storm is about 120 to 125 miles south of Mobile, Alabama, still moving at 2 mph..

"Sally has been very difficult to predict and it has been bumping around out in the Gulf," he said..

"Because of that, the predictability is very, very low.".

Usually within 36 hours, the National Hurricane Center has an idea of where a storm will make landfall..

Reeves said with less than 24 hours before it hits land, Sally's destination is still unclear..

He said he was told during a 2:45 p.m. update from Mississippi Emergency Management Agency that landfall could occur anywhere from Biloxi to Destin, Florida..

"There's still a lot of uncertainty with this particular storm," Reeves said..

Landfall is expected around 9 a.m., which is both good and bad, the governor said..

"The potential for a water event is significant," Reeves said..

In addition, Jackson County is expected to see 10-15 inches of rain..

Both counties are expected to see plenty of flash flooding  Other counties that can expect to see a significant impact from Sally through flash flooding include Harrison, Greene and Wayne..

Reeves said there are about 120 people in shelters throughout the state, including six in a medical needs shelter in Stone County..

3 p.m.: Walmart closes stores ahead of Sally  Walmart closed dozens of locations in Mississippi, Alabama and Florida ahead of Hurricane Sally making landfall..

2:15 p.m.: Hancock, Harrison counties reacts to storm  By early afternoon Tuesday, winds began to pick up speed as Hurricane Sally slowly approached the Gulf Coast..

Street signs were shaking and some began to give way to the force of the gusts..

Parts of Mississippi 603 in Hancock County were lined with cars, boats and the occasional lawn mower to protect them from the storm surge that has inundated low-lying neighborhoods in the area..

A few miles away in Bay St. Louis, Beau Gelpi said he's not overly concerned about his situation..

"We've been keeping a careful eye on it since it developed," Gelpi said..

"We've been glad to see the eastern shift, but we don't want anything bad for our friends in Mobile.".

As waves driven by an easterly wind crashed over the seawall in front of his home, he talked about his home being 24 feet above sea-level and how much surge he expects..

"We're thinking it's maybe 4 feet over normal," Gelpi said..

It's 10 feet up to the road, so I don't think it will get up to the road..

"  Stan Richardson, of Birmingham, Alabama, who works for SERVO, a company that deals with disaster response and restoration, has been on the road since the day after Labor Day..

Coast residents are taking Sally’s approach in stride..

“Well, I have — not them,” she said, referring to her two children playing on the beach in Gulfport..

The two teams combined to form a 39-person water rescue team and currently have 12 boat teams staged in the Mississippi Gulf Coast region to assist local agencies with any flood or swift water rescue .

"The team is continually monitoring local weather conditions, conducting operational planning and preparing equipment for landfall," McMinn said..

The biggest concern, McMinn said, is a combination of storm surge and rainfall associated with Hurricane Sally..

Even though the teams are staged in Harrison and Hancock counties, they will assist anywhere there is need on the coast..

"Our primary job is regional, so any coastal needs from Jackson County to Hancock County we're here to assist," McMinn said..

Sally tracks to our east, will still bring heavy rain and wind to us.

MERIDIAN, Miss. (WTOK) - OVERVIEW: As of the 4 a.m. update from the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Sally has winds of 85 mph..

The storm is expected to make landfall near the MS/AL border overnight tonight with winds around 85 mph..

The center of Sally will then track into south-central Alabama and weaken to a tropical depression just south of Montgomery..

LOCAL IMPACTS: We will get some rain and wind out of this..

The tornado threat will stay to our south and west..

I can’t completely rule out a tornado in Choctaw County, but chances are very low..

The further south and west you go across our area, the greater the impacts will be..

For example, places in Neshoba County will see less of an impact than compared to places in Choctaw County..

Rainfall totals will generally be 1-6 inches, with some locally lower and higher amounts possible..

Rainfall Thru Thursday (ECMWF Model) (WTOK)  Tropical storm-force winds will be possible, especially in our west Alabama counties..

Winds will be sustained between 15 and 25 mph today, picking up to 25-40 mph overnight and into Wednesday..

Winds could gust as high as 60 mph in Choctaw County..

As for timing, Sally has slowed down a bit and so our impact times will be different than compared to what was forecast yesterday..

Expect to see a few showers from time to time on our Tuesday as some of the outer bands affect our area..

Conditions will begin to worsen overnight and the heaviest of the rain will affect southeastern portions of our area by Wednesday morning and through the early afternoon..

Conditions will start to improve by Wednesday evening..

There is still some uncertainty in the forecast because Sally has still not made its turn due northward..

Once it does, we’ll have a better idea of what our exact impacts will be..

Few more clouds, stray rain chances from Hurricane Sally.

Weekday broadcast of WYMT Mountain News at 5:30  HAZARD, Ky. (WYMT) - Very nice and gorgeous weather continues throughout the week, however, a few more clouds and stray rain chances are possible as Hu.

Tonight and Tomorrow  Tonight we will see mostly clear skies with overnight lows in the upper 50s to lower 60s..

We’ll warm up slightly Wednesday with highs getting back into the lower 80s..

We’ll see that mixture of sun and clouds throughout the day as the remnants of Hurricane Sally move into the region..

Clouds will move in later Wednesday night with temperatures dropping into the lower 60s..

Extended Forecast  Thursday a few more clouds and a few stray rain chances are possible as Sally moves closer to the mountains..

A few of our Virginia Counties could see stray rain chances, but honestly, most of us should stay dry..

Highs will be in the upper 70s to lower 80s with overnight lows in the mid to upper 50s Thursday..

A weak cold front will move in and bring us AMAZING weather for the end of the week and the weekend!.

Sunshine returns Friday with highs in the lower 70s with overnight lows in the upper 40s to lower 50s!.

You might need a light jacket for some Friday night football..

Highs will be in the lower 70s with overnight lows in the upper 40s to lower 50s..

We will see plenty of sunshine both days as well!!.

High pressure will keep us on the dry side this weekend and that amazing weather looks to continue into the new week..

WDHN Storm Team: Here’s how Hurricane Sally could impact the Tri-State.

DOTHAN, Ala. (WDHN) — From just a tropical depression on Saturday to a category 2 hurricane today, Sally has intensified very rapidly..

And considering it’s expected to make landfall in the next 24-36 hours, our Alabama, Florida, and Georgia viewers need to prepare for potential severe weather..

Hurricane Sally’s hurricane force wind wield is fairly small, extending only about 25 miles from the center of the storm; however, the tropical storm force winds can be felt about 125 miles its center.

While we are not expected to see any wind speeds of hurricane strength (74+ mph) we could see sustained winds and especially wind gusts of 40+ mph this week..

We already saw two of Sally’s outer rain bands move through the Tri-State today, and there will be plenty more of those over the next 3 or 4 days..

These bands could produce a few tornadoes in our area, so create and solidify a plan with your family tonight about how to take cover if there is a tornado warning and what to do if the tornado strike.

Besides tornadoes, we could see a lot of rain over the next few days..

Most of the rain will fall tomorrow and Wednesday..

Keep an eye on small children, pets, and even teenagers that might think swimming in flooded streams is a fun idea..

Entering fast moving water, especially if it is brown (indicative of speeds fast enough to erode the embankments), is never a good idea..

And if you run into flooded roadways while driving: turn around, don’t drown..

By Friday, the system will be much weaker and move further away from the Tri-State..

We’ll keep the scatterd storm chances since the will be tropical moisture left over from the storm and a front moving through our area Friday and Saturday..

That front will keep us in the low 80s during the afternoons and low to middle 60s in the mornings..

It will be our first real taste of Fall this year and will even lead to much more pleasant conditions at the beginning of next week..

SEVERE WEATHER THREAT:  The main concern will be a few tornadoes both Tuesday and Wednesday..

Damaging winds from Sally itself will not be very likely, but these brief tornadoes can form very quickly and cause damage especially to mobile homes..

Know how you and your family will respond to a tornado warning if one is issued for your area..

If the storm tracks a little further south than is currently expected, we could see more than 4 inches of rain in the next few days with much of it occurring rapidly in these outer bands..

Watch out for flooded roadways and the typical flood-prone areas..

If you have questions, email me at mwine@wdhn.com or message me on Twitter @MatthewWine_wx or on my Facebook weather page..

I will also be live on Facebook multiple times over the next few days, so you can ask questions there as well!.

Hurricane Sally video: Hurricane Hunter plane sent to Gulf.

(Credit: Lt. Cmdr. Doremus of the NOAA Corps)  NEW YORK (1010 WINS) -- The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Monday afternoon sent one if it's turbo prop Hurricane Hunters to Hurrican.

The NOAA released video of the trip, which took place on a Lockheed Orion four-engine aircraft -- nicknamed "Miss Piggy.".

Lt. Cmdr. Doremus of the NOAA Corps shot the video..

The aircraft was sent to monitor overall conditions, including wind waves and swell..

The NOAA captioned the video, "Sea state seen below NOAA WP-3D Orion N43RF 'Miss Piggy' in Hurricane Sally on Sept. 14, 2020.".

Sally was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane Monday afternoon and is expected to possibly make landfall late Tuesday..

Hurricane Sally slows to a crawl, threatens historic floods.

Forecasters expect Sally to make landfall late Tuesday or early Wednesday near the Alabama-Mississippi state line..

With nearly 2 feet of rain possible in some spots..

Example video title will go here for this video  WAVELAND, Mississippi — Hurricane Sally drifted in a slow crawl Tuesday toward the northern Gulf Coast, threatening dangerous storm surge and relentles.

"  The National Hurricane Center expects Sally to remain a Category 1 hurricane, with top sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph) when it makes landfall late Tuesday or early Wednesday..

The storm's sluggish pace made it harder to predict exactly where its center will strike, though it was expected to reach land near the Mississippi-Alabama state line..

The hurricane's slow movement not only delayed landfall, but also exacerbated the threat of heavy rain and storm surge..

Sally remained a dangerous storm Tuesday even after losing power, its fiercest winds having dropped considerably from a peak of 100 mph (161 kph) on Monday..

By late morning Tuesday, hurricane warnings stretched from east of Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to Navarre, Florida..

Rainfall of up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) was forecast near the coast..

There was a chance the storm could also spawn tornadoes and dump isolated rain accumulations of 30 inches (76 centimeters)..

As rain grew heavier Tuesday, many businesses appeared to be closed at exits along the I-10 highway that runs parallel to the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Florida..

Most boat slips at Gulfport's marina were empty, and many businesses had metal storm shutters or plywood covering the windows..

David Espinosa walked the streets of Pascagoula, Mississippi, Tuesday afternoon, drenched by the rain..

He wasn't worried much about Sally, having found his pickup truck in a tree after Hurricane Katrina wrecked much of Mississippi's coast in 2005..

Espinosa had just moved back to the area a few days ago, after a long stint in Oklahoma City..

“We just didn’t know there would be another hurricane when we got back,” Espinosa said..

The National Hurricane Center predicted storm surge along Alabama's coast, including Mobile Bay, could reach 7 feet (2.1 meters) above ground..

The storm was moving at only 2 mph (4 kph) Tuesday afternoon, centered about 105 miles (165 kilometers) south of Mobile, Alabama, and 60 miles (95 kilometers) east of the mouth of the Mississippi Rive.

Forecasters expected Sally to move slowly northward Tuesday, with the storm's center bypassing the coast of southeastern Louisiana..

The threat to Louisiana was easing as officials in some areas reversed evacuation orders that had been issued for areas that had been feared to be a risk of flooding from Sally..

In New Orleans, government offices and public school operations were slated to reopen Wednesday..

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared an emergency in 13 counties as rain from Sally's outer bands pummeled the Panhandle on Tuesday..

“It’s pretty windy, but nobody’s being knocked down..

Smith was serving hot dogs and pizza and planned to close late Tuesday afternoon or when the bridge to the mainland closed, whichever comes first..

WAVELAND, Miss. (AP) — Hurricane Sally, one of four storms churning simultaneously in the Atlantic, closed in on the Gulf Coast on Monday with rapidly strengthening winds of at least 100 mph (161 kph).

The slow-moving storm was forecast to brush the southeastern tip of Louisiana and then blow ashore late Tuesday or early Wednesday near the Mississippi-Alabama state line, the National Hurricane Cente.

Hurricane warnings stretched from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Navarre, Florida..

President Donald Trump issued an emergency declaration for parts of Louisiana and Mississippi on Monday, an action that authorizes federal emergency officials to coordinate disaster relief efforts and.

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey asked the president to do the same for her state after the National Weather Service in Mobile warned of the increasing likelihood of "dangerous and potentially historic flooding..

With a population of 400,000 people, it is the largest metro area along the Gulf Coast between New Orleans and Tampa, Florida..

All 12 casinos were ordered to shut down Monday afternoon and Gov. Tate Reeves urged residents of low-lying areas to prepare to evacuate..

“This is the real deal, and it deserves your attention,” Reeves wrote on Twitter..

Sally was about 135 miles (217 kilometers) south of Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday night, moving at 6 mph (9 kph)..

Sally was moving west-northwest Monday night but forecasters expected it to turn slightly east..

People in New Orleans worried that Sally would pose the latest test for pumps used in the low-lying city's century-old drainage system..

It is the seventh hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, and it could end up being the most destructive..

On Monday it strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane with 100 mph winds, and we are being told that it could potentially become a Category 3 storm before it finally makes landfall..

But the wind speed is not what makes this storm potentially so dangerous..

Hurricane Sally is expected to slow down significantly as it approaches the Gulf Coast, and we are now being told that some areas could see up to two feet of rain..

That could mean “life-threatening flooding”, especially if this storm directly hits New Orleans..

Advertisement  We all remember what happened when Hurricane Katrina hit the city of New Orleans in September 2005..

Since that time, we have not seen a hurricane directly hit the city of New Orleans during the month of September, and this is something that I have been tracking every year..

At this hour, we still don’t know where Hurricane Sally will make landfall..

It is heading toward New Orleans, but some forecasters expect it to make a very sharp turn to the north right before it gets there..

In 2005, Hurricane Katrina was a Category 3 storm when it finally reached New Orleans, and it is anticipated that Hurricane Sally will be a Category 2 or a Category 3 storm when it ultimately makes la.

In fact, weather.com says that “additional strengthening is anticipated” in the hours ahead… Hurricane Sally has rapidly intensified and additional strengthening is anticipated as it tracks toward the.

So if Hurricane Sally is already a Category 2 storm right now, it would seem likely that it would reach Category 3 at some point..

But what makes this storm so unique is that it is supposed to move extremely slowly once it reaches the Gulf Coast, and that could mean “up to 48 hours of storm surge and rainfall”… READ MORE.

WALTON COUNTY, Fla. (WMBB) — Out of caution for oncoming Hurricane Sally, some school districts and courthouses have announced closures..

Bay, Okaloosa, Franklin, Walton and Gulf school districts are all closed Tuesday..

Also, Bay Haven Charter schools, Haney Technical Center, Florida State University Panama City and Gulf Coast State College have announced that they will be closed Tuesday..

Courthouses in Bay, Gulf, Walton and Okaloosa will also be closed as well..

Hurricane Sally strengthens into a Category 2 storm on Monday..

There’s a chance it will make landfall in southeastern Louisiana, a state still recovering from the aftermath of Hurricane Laura..

According to the National Hurricane Center, the center of Sally is expected to move near the southeastern Louisiana coast Monday night..

It is to make a landfall on the Gulf Coast late on Tuesday, possibly as a Category 3 hurricane..

Hurricane Sally strengthens to Category 2 as it moves toward the US Gulf Coast, write Eliott C. McLaughlin, Amir Vera and Hollie Silverman for CNN..

Forecasters warn of storm surge and flash flooding  Further strengthening is expected in the next 24 hours before the storm makes landfall, the NHC said..

Emergency declaration for Louisiana and Mississippi  “Since Sally is forecast to be moving very slowly around the time of landfall, a slower rate of weakening is indicated since a large portion of the.

Alabama and Mississippi get ready  Officials were handing out sandbags in Saraland, Alabama, north of Mobile..

While residents on Dauphin Island, a barrier isle on the Alabama coast, were also preparing for flooding..

Shelters prepared  Shelters are also preparing for the incoming storm, but are keeping Covid-19 in mind..

Landfall on Wednesday  Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves said Hurricane Sally was expected to make landfall around Biloxi at 2:00 am (0600 GMT) on Wednesday..

“The storm surge projections continue to be worrisome with anywhere from five to eight feet (1.5 to 2.4 meters) of coastal surge,” Reeves said..

“We are continuing to be very concerned about the amount of rainfall,” he said, adding that some areas could be drenched in as much as 20 inches (50 cm) of rain..

Tropical cyclones Sally is one of five active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean..

The others are Hurricane Paulette, tropical storms Teddy and Vicky and tropical depression Rene..

According to meteorologists, the only other time there were five active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic at the same time was in September 1971..

Hurricane Paulette, a Category 2 storm, pounded the island of Bermuda on Monday with strong winds and heavy rains, according to the NHC..

Hurricane Sally's severe impacts to stay east of Louisiana.

The National Hurricane Center says Hurricane Sally will make Landfall early Wednesday morning near the Mississippi / Alabama state line..

If the 10:00pm forecast track holds, Sally will remain a category two hurricane with top winds of 110 miles per hour before landfall..

The Hurricane Center says that will mean destructive winds, up to 20 inches or rain and inundating storm surge where the eye wall comes ashore..

The Abrahamic Accord: A Great Awakening Or A Great Shaking?.

(OPINION) ETH – The following is a piece written by Mike Evans regarding the official signing of the “The Abrahamic Covenant” peace treaty with Israel and the UAE..

Evans describes this event as a sign of “Great Awakening” but as we have now entered into the peak of hurricane season and hurricane Sally approaching the gulf coast, there are many who are on edge as.

Will we see a “Great Awakening” or a “Great Shaking” as a result of dividing Israel that has been warned about in the Word of God by both Zechariah and Joel?.

Excerpt from CBN: I’m on my way to the White House for the signing of the Abrahamic Accord between the UAE and Israel..

This normalization of relations between Israel and its Middle East neighbor through the American diplomacy of President Donald Trump and his team serves as a truly historic development..

Yet there may be more good news ahead—a Great Awakening that will revive both America and the world..

Two historical examples offer insight into this intriguing connection between America’s support of Israel and revival..

In 1948, Israel became a nation once again after 1,900 years..

While many have acknowledged the miraculous nature of this event, one of the key supporters of Israel’s rebirth was the United States..

Advertisement  What was taking place in America spiritually at this time?.

Author Patrick Morley notes the sweeping spiritual awakening that spread across the country: It was at this time that a great generation of Christian leaders emerged..

In 1949, Billy Graham’s distinguished career, which popularized evangelical Christianity for a new generation, exploded on the scene during his Los Angeles crusade sponsored by the Christian Businessm.

An estimated 180,000,000 people attended his nearly 400 crusades, and millions more viewed on television..

Between June 5 to 10, the Six-Day War broke out, leading to a surprising victory by Israel’s military..

They defeated Egyptian, Syrian, and Jordanian forces, expanding Israel’s territory to include the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, and the West Bank..

Of great importance, the aftermath of the Six-Day War allowed Jews the opportunity to visit the Old City of Jerusalem and pray at the Western Wall..

1967 also marked the beginning of a growing Jewish diaspora, with a wave of Jews making Aliyah to Israel from around the world..

Hurricane Sally lumbers toward U.S. Gulf Coast, threatens 'catastrophic flooding'.

GULF SHORES, Ala. (Reuters) - Hurricane Sally moved slowly closer to the U.S. Gulf Coast on Tuesday, threatening historic floods as rain and storm-force winds started lashing the shore, and governors .

Sally could hit the Alabama, Florida and Mississippi coasts on Tuesday night or early Wednesday causing massive flash flooding and storm surges of up to 7 feet (2 meters) in some spots, the National H.

Its languid pace recalls 2017’s Hurricane Harvey, which dumped several feet of rain over a period of days on the Houston area, causing major damage..

More than 2 feet of rain was expected in some areas, with “extreme life-threatening flash flooding likely through Wednesday,” an NHC forecaster said..

While Sally’s winds decreased to 80 mph (130 kpm) at 7 p.m.(2400 GMT), it was moving at a glacial pace of two mph..

Sally was 75 miles (135 km) south of Mobile, Alabama and spreading tropical-storm-force winds onshore, the NHC said..

We’re going to ride it out,” said Jennie Bonfiglio, manager of the 1862 Malaga Inn in Mobile’s downtown historic district..

About half the 38 rooms had guests, and the hotel was stocked with flashlights, batteries, bottled water and canned food, she said..

“The wind has definitely picked up and some of the streets are starting to flood..

I definitely wouldn’t go outside unless you had to.”.

Sally will slow even more after landfall, causing Atlanta to see as much as 6 inches (15 cm) of rain through Friday, said Jim Foerster, chief meteorologist at DTN, an energy, agriculture and weather d.

“It’s going to be a catastrophic flooding event” for much of the southeastern United States, Forester said, with Mobile to the western part of the Florida Panhandle taking the brunt of the storm..

Damage from Sally is expected to reach $2 billion to $3 billion, said Chuck Watson of Enki Research, which models and tracks tropical storms..

That could rise if the storm’s heaviest rainfall happens over land instead of the Gulf..

By mid-afternoon, Panama City, Florida, had received 5 to 6 inches of rain, while offshore totals were around 11 inches, Watson said..

Governors from Louisiana to Florida warned people to leave low-lying communities and Mobile County Sheriff Sam Cochran told residents of flood-prone areas that if they choose to ride out the storm, it.

The causeway to Dauphin Island, Alabama, at the entrance to Mobile Bay was already flooded and impassable by Tuesday morning, the mayor said..

Coastal roads in Pascagoula, Mississippi, were flooding and some electrical wires were down, according to photos and social media posts from the police department, which asked people to respect road b.

Steady winds and bands of rain had started to arrive in Gulf Shores, Alabama, by Tuesday morning..

Samantha Frederickson, who moved recently to Gulf Shores, hit the beach to catch a view of the storm surf..

“When it gets to the point we don’t feel comfortable, we’ll take off,” she said..

Gulf Coast bracing for flooding, more as Hurricane Sally churns toward landfall.

The northern Gulf Coast was getting hit early Tuesday by slow-moving Hurricane Sally's outer bands, which arrived with the threat of strong winds, life-threatening storm surge and flash flooding..

The storm strengthened earlier Monday to a category 2 hurricane and made its way across the Gulf of Mexico toward Mississippi and Alabama with 100-mph sustained winds..

Sally is expected to make landfall late Tuesday or Wednesday..

Sally's slow speed prompted worries that the storm would stall out over land, dumping lots of water and flooding coastal communities..

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey ordered the state's beaches to close Monday afternoon in preparation for the storm..

"I urge everyone to tune in to their trusted weather source, and pay attention to your local officials for updates regarding your area as they make further recommendations based off the unique needs o.

The storm's maximum sustained winds of 100 mph are expected to grow stronger overnight Monday, the National Hurricane Center said..

Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Saturday..

“While we ultimately don't know where Sally will make landfall, much of Southeast Louisiana is in the storm's cone and the risk of tropical storm force or hurricane strength winds continues to increas.

“This storm has the potential to be very serious.”.

President Donald Trump on Monday night approved an emergency declaration for Alabama, which authorizes federal assistance, due to the hurricane..

The president has also approved emergency declarations for Mississippi and Louisiana..

My team and I are closely monitoring extremely dangerous Hurricane Sally..

We are fully engaged with State & Local Leaders to assist the great people of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi..

@GovernorKayIvey @LouisianaGov @TateReeves — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2020  Louisiana is still reeling from Hurricane Laura, which hit in late August as a Category 4 storm and .

Electric services remain “severely limited” in much of the city, which is also under a boil advisory for water..

Tennessee authorities sent 35 members of various agencies to Louisiana to offer support to the weather battered state, including employees of the Metro Nashville Office of Emergency Management and Nas.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also sent dozens of search and rescue personnel and boats to the state..

Sally is not expected to bring as intense surges and winds as Laura, but at the mouth of the Mississippi River, storm surge levels, which vary based on the tidal cycles, could reach as high as 11 feet.

On Monday night, the storm was 100 miles east of the Mississippi River and 135 miles southeast of Biloxi, Mississippi, the National Hurricane Center said..

During a news conference earlier, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said that although the forecast track for Sally had shifted east slightly, storm surge projections still topped nine feet for one coastal.

"It is still anticipated that we will bear the brunt of this storm," he said..

Though she doesn't live in an evacuation zone, she made the decision to leave after learning that the storm shifted..

Hurricanes are "literally part of our life," she said in an interview Monday..

"I just think people should have the mind-set of, 'I'd rather overprepare and it not be as bad as for us,' than to be underprepared and suffer the consequences of that.”.

"You think, ‘Oh it’s not coming this way,’ and all of a sudden, four hours later, it has changed course," said Yandle, 38, a native of the area who's experienced other powerful hurricanes to hit Louis.

“For whatever reason, this storm is probably the most anxious I’ve ever been,” said Yandle, adding: "It’s 2020..

What other event can possibly happen that we haven’t gotten yet?.

"  In New Orleans, meanwhile, officials were also preparing for the storm..

Mayor LaToya Cantrell said Monday that it was good news that the storm had shifted, but the water in some canals had still been drained to prepare for a downpour and all of the city's 99 drainage pump.

"Forecasts are not certain where the landfall will be, but it is definitely in the path of the city of New Orleans.".

Hurricane, Storm Surge Watches Issued for Texas, Louisiana Coasts Ahead of Tropical Storm Beta.

At a Glance Tropical Storm Beta is several hundred miles east of Brownsville, TX..

New watches have been issued for portions of the Texas and Louisiana coasts..

This system may meander in the western Gulf the next several days..

Where this system ultimately ends up remains highly uncertain..

This slow mover is a potential flood danger along the western Gulf Coast..

Tropical Storm Beta will meander in the western Gulf of Mexico into next week and poses a major threat of rainfall and coastal flooding to the Texas and Louisiana coasts..

New watches have been issued for the entire Texas coast and a portion of the Louisiana coast, including the area of coastal Louisiana hit by Hurricane Laura a few weeks ago..

Beta's formation is the 10th Atlantic named storm to form so far this month, which is the most on record for any September, according to Dr. Phil Klotzbach..

September is typically the most active month of the hurricane season..

(MORE: 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season is Now Using Greek Alphabet For Only the Second Time)  Current Alerts  A Hurricane Watch has been issued from Port Aransas, Texas to High Island, Texas, including.

Hurricane conditions are possible in this area on Monday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late Sunday..

A storm surge watch has been issued from Port Mansfield, Texas to Cameron, Louisiana, including Baffin Bay, Corpus Christi Bay, Copano Bay, Aransas Bay, San Antonio Bay, Matagorda Bay, Galveston Bay, .

A tropical storm watch has been issued from south of Port Aransas to the Mouth of the Rio Grande and east of High Island to Morgan City, Louisiana..

Tropical storm conditions are possible in this area by late Saturday..

Current Wind Watches and Warnings  Beta's Forecast  With plenty of warm ocean water and lessening wind shear, this system is expected to intensify gradually through the weekend..

Some dry air and wind shear are hindering Beta's circulation this morning..

How strong it will become remains uncertain but is currently expected to become a hurricane..

Water temperatures are very warm, which supports intensification, and wind shear should remain low to moderate, at most..

However, it could be impacted by some dry air and it could eventually churn up enough cooler water below the surface to keep a lid on its intensification..

Current Storm Status and Projected Path (The red-shaded area denotes the potential path of the center of the tropical cyclone..

Beta's center may hop around over the next few days as it tries to keep up with the thunderstorms that will power Beta over the next week or so..

This will likely lead to jumps in the forecast left and right..

Even without the jumps in the forecast, this system has a number of twists and turns in its future..

First, a weak upper-level low over Texas should help nudge this system north over the next day or so..

Advertisement But then that upper-low will weaken and move away, leaving the system steered by a weak area of high pressure setting up over the south-central U.S. by early next week that should cause .

This should be the most prevalent motion through the weekend and possibly into Monday..

After that, a dip in the jet stream and some lower pressures over the South may pick up Beta and take it northeastward by the middle part of next week, near or over the Texas or Louisiana coasts..

Steering Features (Two big weather features will push Beta around in the northwestern Gulf over the next five days. ).

It certainly won't be in any hurry for the next several days..

Slow-moving tropical cyclones can be prolific rainfall producers, as we saw along the Gulf Coast and inland with Hurricane Sally..

(MORE: A Hurricane's Forward Speeds Can Be As Important as Its Intensity)  Given Beta's slow movement, heavy rainfall and flooding is an increasing danger near the Texas coast and possibly the Louisia.

Given the numerous changes in forward direction and upper-level winds, the zone of heaviest rainfall will likely change from day to day..

Rainfall Outlook (This should be interpreted as a broad outlook of where the heaviest rain may fall.).

Increased surf and rip currents are also expected from northeastern Mexico to the northern Gulf Coast, beginning as soon as this weekend..

The National Weather Service notes that significant coastal flooding is possible on the middle and upper Texas coast beginning Saturday morning and continuing through at least Tuesday morning, and min.

Persistent onshore flow and a possible storm surge component in combination with heavy rainfall could only worsen flooding near the coast into next week..

Here's the current storm surge forecast from the National Hurricane Center:  For now, all interests near the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts should monitor closely the progress of this system and have.

More than 320,000 businesses and homes are still without power, too..

Rescuers have had to use high-water vehicles to reach those trapped by Sally's floods, and more flooding may be on its way through the weekend with overflowing rivers and streams, the National Weather.

The remnants of Sally on Friday prompted some coastal flood warnings in Virginia and Maryland around the Chesapeake Bay..

The storm crawled ashore Wednesday as a slow-moving, powerful Category 2 storm near Gulf Shores, Alabama..

There's only one name left on the 2020 list of names:Next up: The Greek alphabet..

As Sally lurched through the Alabama-Florida border, it soaked the area with torrential rains, battered buildings and boats and made the streets of Pensacola look like rivers..

Thirty inches fell in Orange Beach, Alabama, and in isolated areas of Florida, the Weather Service said..

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state is pouring hundreds of thousands of resources into the northwest part of the state, including gasoline, generators, ambulance crews, food and drinking water..

For right now, “We have all hands on deck,” DeSantis said..

“We want to make sure to continue to keep people safe..

"  “While it could be much worse, it’s been mighty bad,” added Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey..

Coast Guard calls off search for boater feared dead  The U.S. Coast Guard has ended its search for a Pensacola boater who went missing the day that Hurricane Sally struck..

Brandon William Nicholson, 27, was last seen Wednesday morning, and U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer Third Class Carlos Galarza told the Pensacola News Journal that the search for Nicholson wa.

“The reason he departed from his area is because he had a pontoon boat that was taken away by the storm,” Galarza said..

In an attempt to recover his pontoon boat, Nicholson chased the runaway vessel in a 12-foot Jon boat..

The U.S. Coast Guard conducted shoreline searches and six overflight searches for Nicholson to no avail before calling off its search efforts, according to Galarza..

Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan said Friday it would be the county's first Sally-related death..

Hours after the National Weather Service announced Friday that tropical storm Wilfred had formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, subtropical storm Alpha neared Portugal..

Once Wilfred officially reached tropical storm status Friday, it became the last storm with a name from the official list of 21 used by the National Hurricane Center in 2020..

"Get out the Greek alphabet for the rest of 2020," forecasters said in their update on Wilfred's formation..

Not long after, Alpha officially became the first named storm using Greek letters for 2020..

Wilfred is about 630 miles west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands but is expected to weaken this weekend as it continues its path west-northwest, while Alpha is expected to be short-lived but soak p.

Only once before have forecasters relied on the Greek alphabet, during the hyperactive 2005 season wound up using six Greek names..

2nd Sally-related death reported in Alabama  A second death in Alabama tied to the storm was reported Friday..

Baldwin County coroner Dr. Brian Pierce said the person who died was involved in storm cleanup efforts in Foley..

The first death tied to Hurricane Sally occurred Wednesday in Baldwin County in an apparent drowning..

Other rivers near Norfolk and Hampton, Virginia, were also experiencing minor flooding Friday..

West Pensacola residents left to pick up the pieces after Sally  Residents at Warrington's Forest Creek Apartments know that even a mild storm could — and has — resulted in several feet of standing wa.

So when a storm the magnitude of Hurricane Sally barreled through Pensacola, the renters at the flood-prone apartments knew it would be a life-changing affair..

"In 2015, I lost everything and now I'm about to lose everything again," said 55-year-old Karen Robinson, who said she's experienced at least four floods at the Forest Creek complex since 2012..

Robinson stayed at a relative's house Tuesday, just ahead of Sally's landfall..

When she returned Wednesday, she came home to chest-high waters outside of her front door and at least 3 feet of water inside the unit..

Her refrigerator was overturned by water, and most of her furniture and living room items were beyond salvation..

Like many other tenants at Forest Creek, she's spent much of the past 24 hours packing her sedan with as many clothes, shoes and food as she can..

"Just going back to save what I can save," Robinson said..

In five years aboard the Tropical Hideaway Too, Jerry Ash has ridden out some bad storms before, but Hurricane Sally was different..

"No one thought it would be like this," said Ash, who anchored at the Perdido Key RV Resort and Marina..

The man stuck on the pillar under the Theo Baars Bridge certainly wasn’t expecting it either..

“I knew if I could get to my boat, I could get to him,” Ash said..

Pensacola Bay Bridge may be out of commission for a month  After a crane aboard a barge crashed into the Pensacola Bay Bridge on Wednesday, destroying a section of the bridge’s surface, the bridge may.

DeSantis said his understanding was that Skanska, a construction company, had opted not to move the equipment out of the area because of forecasts indicating Sally wouldn’t have a major impact in the .

However, multiple construction barges broke free from their docks during the hurricane..

"I'd much rather have more precautions taken and then not have to use up resources (after the fact)," DeSantis said..

Florida Sen. Doug Broxson estimated it would be 30 to 60 days before the bridge, among just a handful of arteries between Escambia and Santa Rosa counties, is open again..

Vernon High School principal helps his flooded community after Hurricane Sally.

VERNON, Fla. (WJHG) - “Our biggest priority has been, if there’s a need, get somebody there to help,” Brian Riviere, principal of Vernon High School, said..

In the small, tight-knit town of Vernon, neighbors are helping neighbors..

“Basically anything we can offer, whether it’s fill up sandbags, or get water and ice out to some of these families, and in a lot of cases it’s been trying to get families out of their homes, they jus.

Riviere has been working since Hurricane Sally to get resources to people who are trapped by the storm’s water..

“We’ve done everything from drive a vehicle probably where we shouldn’t, to towing boats behind the trucks, four-wheelers towing boats to trucks and using boats as a way to carry sandbags and resource.

The water continues to rise in Vernon, and Riviere said they will keep on helping residents..

“Grading roads and bringing dirt as fast as they can, but when, an example like this, you have water still washing across the road, that’s not going to help,” he said..

Riviere added that he hopes students can return to school soon..

“(We will) Excuse absences where a bus simply can’t get down a road or a family can’t get out, but we know we need to be open and have power on and give them their two meals and just make sure they kn.

Gulf Power offers update on its Hurricane Sally response.

PENSACOLA, Fla. (PRESS RELEASE) -  Gulf Power restores more than 40% of customers impacted within the first day of Hurricane Sally’s exit from its service area; heavy traffic and closed and damaged ro.

Currently, approximately 157,000 customers are without electricity mainly in the hardest hit areas of Escambia and Santa Rosa counties..

Hundreds of thousands still without power in Sally cleanup.

LOXLEY, Ala. (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of people were still without power Friday along the Alabama coast and the Florida Panhandle in the aftermath of Hurricane Sally as officials assessed millions.

While the cleanup pressed on, the record-shattering hurricane season notched another milestone: Forecasters ran out of traditional names for storms after three new systems formed in about six hours..

That forced them to begin using the Greek alphabet for only the second time since the 1950s..

In Loxley, Alabama, Catherine Williams lost power and some of her roof to Sally..

The storm also destroyed three pecan trees in her yard that she used to try to make ends meet..

I took my last heart pill today,” said Williams, who has been laid off twice from her job as a cook because of the economic problems caused by COVID-19..

She hoped that the Red Cross would soon show up at her home..

Two people in Alabama were reported killed — a drowning and a death during the cleanup in Baldwin County..

In Florida, authorities were looking for a missing kayaker who was feared dead in Escambia County..

(Source: AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)  The supercharged Atlantic hurricane season has produced so many named storms that scientists ran out of traditional names as Tropical Storm Wilfred developed in the .

It was only the second time that has happened since forecasters standardized the naming system in 1953..

Two hours after Wilfred took shape, the National Hurricane Center moved to the Greek alphabet when Subtropical Storm Alpha formed just off the coast of Portugal..

It was followed later in the day by Tropical Storm Beta, which formed in the western Gulf of Mexico..

The same practice will govern storm names for the rest of the hurricane season, which lasts until the end of November..

The onslaught of hurricanes has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms..

In Pensacola, Mamie Patterson was cleaning the yard of her cousin who was recovering from heart surgery after they lost power in a low-income neighborhood in Pensacola..

Patterson’s mother uses an oxygen machine that they took to an uncle’s home to charge because he had power..

She saw utility trucks all over the city and wondered when power would be restored in her neighborhood, where several inches of water was standing in streets more than 48 hours after the storm..

“I hate to say it, but it’s the ghetto neighborhoods..

Elsewhere in the city, Karen Robinson sat on the steps of her first-floor apartment and rattled off a list of belongings ruined by 4 feet (120 centimeters) of water from Sally — clothes, shoes, furnit.

It took months to recover from a 2015 flood after a heavy rainstorm sent nearly the same amount of water from a creek into the 200-unit complex..

She was concerned because more than two months are left in hurricane season..

We had piles of sand everywhere, piles of debris everywhere, but the roads were open,” Mayor Ken Thomas said..

With the dunes that provide some protection to the island gone, Thomas said people will be nervous for the rest of the storm season..

“There’s a hurricane for everyone out there,” he said..

Escambia County, which includes Pensacola, estimated that Sally caused at least $21 million in damage to public infrastructure such as roads and drainage..

It will likely cost an additional $8 million to restore the sand washed away at Pensacola Beach, officials said..

The year-old Three Mile Bridge that connects Pensacola to the beaches was heavily damaged in at least two places, and authorities do not know how much money or time it will take to fix..

In several places along the Gulf Coast, ships washed up on shore..

They included pleasure boats and even a replica of Christopher Columbus' ship the Nina, which docked in Pensacola to ride out the storm and came loose from its mooring..

The vessel came to rest in mud and grass at a nearby marina..

Back in the Atlantic, Hurricane Teddy was a powerful Category 4 storm about 850 miles (1,370 kilometers) southeast of Bermuda..

The island was hit directly by Hurricane Paulette on Monday, and forecasters said a hurricane watch for Teddy may be issued soon..

Hurricane Sally: Skanska says removing barges before storm was neither 'safe nor feasible'.

Multiple barges broke loose during Hurricane Sally and scattered throughout the area, washing up in downtown Pensacola, near Naval Air Station Pensacola, Garcon Point Bridge, near the Escambia Bay Bri.

In a statement Thursday evening, Skanska USA, the construction company that owned an as yet unspecified number of the vessels, said it regrets the incidents, but noted it made "all appropriate prepara.

"Skanska continuously evaluates weather conditions and reviews our project preparations accordingly," the statement said..

"What became Hurricane Sally – a Category 2 storm at landfall with sustained winds of over 100 miles per hour – was until 36 hours before forecasted as a tropical storm with its most severe impacts ex.

"Skanska made all appropriate preparations for the storm based on the information we had available at the time," the statement continued..

"The sudden shift in the intensity, direction and duration of the storm was unprecedented and entirely unexpected by the entire Pensacola community..

Unfortunately, it was neither safe nor feasible to attempt the removal of barges and other equipment in the brief period between the storm’s sudden intensification and its ultimate landfall..

"  As of Friday, officials were still assessing how much damage the rogue barges caused..

Another vessel carrying a large crane traveled beneath the bridge Wednesday and knocked out a large section of the roadway..

Drone footage taken for the Pensacola News Journal and USA TODAY Network shows far more extensive damage than community members anticipated..

Drone footage captured from above the bridge shows two different sections of the roadway sustained significant damage..

A right-hand lane section of the bridge has a gap where seemingly dozens of yards of roadway collapsed into the bay..

Farther south, an entire section of the bridge was completely gone, leaving a chasm where only the multi-use path on the side of the bridge was intact..

Officials said Thursday they would be out assessing the damage and working to expedite repairs because the bridge is a vital artery between Escambia and Santa Rosa counties..

Separately, a barge approached the Escambia Bay Bridge on Wednesday and appeared to threaten Interstate 10 before running aground nearby..

Another barge struck the main bridge heading into Naval Air Station Pensacola, shutting it down Wednesday night..

Five barges washed up near downtown — four just west of the Missing Children's Memorial and one in front of the Gulf Power building..

Another wedged itself against the Garcon Point Bridge momentarily before dislodging..

Gov. Ron DeSantis addressed the issue during a press conference at Pensacola International Airport on Thursday afternoon..

While he didn't go so far as to affirm suggestions Skanska had been "negligent," he said the Florida Department of Transportation is investigating the incidents and he personally would have liked to h.

"My view is that even though the state was following that same forecast, the Department of Emergency Management had people ready because you can't be sure when it's that close that it's not going to i.

"I think in this situation, there was probably a belief that it wasn't necessary, and whether that was done appropriately or not, I think people look at it..

Our Pensacola Bay Bridge replacement project is no exception..

"  Skanska was contracted by the Florida Department of Transportation to lead an approximately $400 million dollar project to replace both spans of the Pensacola Bay Bridge..

The eastern span of the bridge from Pensacola to Gulf Breeze opened last September and a multi-use path across the bridge was opened to the public last month..

The damage caused by the runaway barges will force the bridge to close for an as-yet-undetermined amount of time, though state Sen. Doug Broxson estimated it could cause a delay of 30 to 60 days..

More:Hurricane Sally: Pensacola Bay Bridge may be out of commission a month or more  The construction firm concluded its statement by saying, "Skanska regrets the impact felt by the local community in.

Most of our team members live and work in Pensacola; we are highly invested in this community and proud of our contributions to its success..

We are in contact with local officials, and we are working closely with the Florida Department of Transportation to assess the damage to the Pensacola Bay Bridge and set a plan of action for its repai.

We are also doing everything possible to have our equipment promptly and safely removed from affected properties..

Unmanned sailboat washes ashore in Panama City Beach after Sally; crew rescued beforehand.

PANAMA CITY BEACH — For those who have walked across the coast over the last couple days near beach access 2 in Bay County, odds are they've seen that something peculiar washed ashore..

At about 10 p.m. Wednesday, after battling roughly 20-foot swells in the face of Hurricane Sally, an unmanned sailboat arrived to the Panhandle following drifting through the Gulf for about three days.

Dubbed "Yes Dear," the 43-foot vessel is the same one that four people were rescued from Sunday roughly 60 nautical miles off the coast of Clearwater, said Erik Villa, a petty officer at a Coast Guard.

More:Forecasts show storm near Texas should stay clear of Florida  "Things like this are important for boaters to learn from," Villa said..

"Whenever they go out that far, having a (beacon) gives you that advantage to send an alert and the Coast Guard will be able to locate you easier.".

After pinpointing the ship, the Coast Guard dispatched a helicopter from Clearwater to try and save the four-person crew..

As winds roared and the boat bounced around like a buoy in the Gulf, the helicopter was forced to turn around..

The Coast Guard then made contact with a nearby container ship that swooped in to the rescue, Villa added..

For Chris Hill, a Texas resident vacationing in Panama City Beach, witnessing a sail boat wash ashore will be something he'll remember forever..

More:Florida DOT road closure notifications for Northwest Florida  "It (was like) a ghost ship coming out of the hurricane," Hill said..

After noticing Yes Dear at about 10 p.m. Wednesday from his balcony at Treasure Island Resort Condominiums, Hill ran down to the beach to take a closer look..

Once there, after notifying the Coast Guard, he waded out into the water and went aboard to make sure no one was in danger..

More:GALLERY: Abandoned Boat Washes Ashore with Hurricane Sally  "It didn't bother me until I noticed the electronics were on," Hill said..

"As soon as I saw that, I knew it wasn't just a break-away.  ".

I just immediately started thinking 'somebody may be on that boat.'.

"  Hill also said that he's since contacted the boat's owner, who asked him not to give out his number to the media..

More:Bay County cities report millions of gallons of sewage overflow after flooding  A Facebook message to the suspected owner went unanswered prior to deadline..

According to Master Chief Mark Kannan of the Coast Guard station in Panama City, they have since inspected the ship..

The vessel was removed in view of a small crowd on Saturday..

Kannan wasn't aware of any damages it caused washing ashore..

"Within 20 minutes of us getting on scene, we realized this could possible be the same boat that was involved in (the rescue near Clearwater," Kannan said..

As Escambia River rises, neighbors watch and wait for more Hurricane Sally flooding.

John Fields poked a stick into the water covering what was normally a grassy field at the Molino Boat Ramp and Fairgrounds Park..

Deep enough to completely submerge a nearby boat ramp..

Recovery:Escambia desperately awaits 'major disaster' declaration from FEMA for Sally recovery  Hurricane Sally:Escambia County leaders plead with public to stay off roads, be patient at gas pumps  Fi.

“It’s flood stage, but it’s not catastrophic,” Fields said..

A flood warning was issued for northern Escambia County communities near Escambia River as the river began cresting Friday afternoon..

Officials estimated the river was would rise to about 25 feet early Friday afternoon, a foot higher than a record set in 1990..

The overflow is expected to damage homes along Worley Road in McDavid and Daffin Road and Fairground Road in Molino..

As waters began to rise Friday, residents along the river made their ways out to the river’s edge to try and gauge the threat..

For the most part, folks seemed confident the impacts wouldn’t be too far reaching..

Richard Marlow surveyed the rising water approaching a little family-owned rental home adjacent to Fairgrounds Park..

He estimated the bottom floor of the building would be washed out..

He said it was frustrating, but that it literally came with the territory..

Marlow said the stormwater from up north in Century and Alabama all flowed down the Escambia River toward the bays, but that it just didn’t have the capacity to hold it all..

“The water is 24 feet up in Century, so it’s gonna go way up into the bottom of the house,” Marlow said..

His personal home was a short distance away from the rental, and he said he expects the water level to keep rising over the next few days..

Still, he said didn’t think the waters would rise high enough to damage his house..

He said he got some downed trees during the hurricane, but nothing else major..

Signs of Sally’s passing were everywhere around Molino..

Powerlines drooped onto the shoulder of the road, often entangled with felled trees..

Most residents of the area said they knew of folks who had vehicles and fences damaged by falling trees, but by word-of- mouth at least, there were no reports of destroyed homes..

Sarah Lewis, who lived a few streets back from the river, tried to prop up a few battered corn stalks in her husband’s garden before declaring it a lost cause..

She said with relief that their orchard of fruits trees had come out of storm intact..

“There was pretty heavy wind just whipping around ... we really did get it.”.

Still, like most of her neighbors, Lewis said it could have been worse..

Lewis’ family got a generator going and had plenty of gas..

They had enough power that her 10- and 11-year-old grandsons, Micah and Christian Callendar, were able to watch a little old-fashioned television via antenna..

Compared to streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, their verdict was “too many commercials.”.

Christian said the had also got a chance to check out the Escambia River..

Lewis said she had seen the river rise during Hurricane Ivan, and she was hoping for neighbors' sake nothing that bad or destructive came out of this storm..

She said generally, she didn’t expect to much destruction in the wider neighborhood..

But she would certainly be glad when it was all over..

“It’s not quite as bad as it could have been” overall, she said, before adding, “it’s a mess..

Central Gulf Coast communities, churches assess damage from Hurricane Sally.

[Episcopal News Service] The latest hurricane to hit the Gulf Coast during this record-setting hurricane season has left churches and residents again assessing the damage, this time in communities ser.

Hurricane Sally moved ashore early Sept. 16 over Gulf Shores, Alabama, as a Category 2 storm, with wind speeds reaching 105 mph..

The storm has been blamed for at least two deaths and caused flooding, power outages and structural damage across the region..

At least four Episcopal churches sustained property damage, as well as the diocese’s camp, Beckwith, in Fairhope, Alabama..

The Rev. Will Lowry, rector of Holy Spirit Episcopal Church in Gulf Shores, reported on Facebook that the church was dealing with downed tree limbs and water that seeped into the church..

“Otherwise we seem to have done well,” Lowry said, though the storm caused varying degrees of damage to some parishioners’ homes..

An email update from the Diocese of the Central Gulf Coast said the diocesan offices were without power and phone service as of Sept. 17..

Other closings were reported in the southern part of the diocese, including at St. Paul’s Episcopal Preschool in Daphne, Alabama..

Christ Episcopal Church in Pensacola, Florida, also reported the church was closed in the days after the storm, and it issued a call on Facebook asking parishioners to contact the parish’s clergy dire.

“We are here on the journey with you as we recover,” the post said..

The Atlantic hurricane season typically runs from June through November, and the number of storms this year already has exhausted meteorologists’ list of names, the earliest that has ever happened..

After Tropical Storm Wilfred formed this week, meteorologists shifted to using letters of the Greek alphabet for only the second time; the first was the devastating 2005 hurricane season, which includ.

Just two weeks before Sally, Hurricane Laura made landfall over southwest Louisiana, near the Texas state line, as one of the most powerful storms to hit the Gulf Coast..

More than a dozen deaths were blamed on the storm, with the worst of the damage centered in and around Lake Charles, Louisiana..

The recent storms and other increasingly frequent and intensifying natural disasters this year, from the West Coast wildfires to an Iowa windstorm, coincide with scientists’ warnings about the growing.

The past five years are the five warmest years on record for global ocean temperatures..

“Warm ocean temperatures are one of the key factors that strengthen hurricane development when overall conditions are conducive for their formation and growth,” according to the Union of Concerned Sci.

“In the future, there may not necessarily be more hurricanes, but there will likely be more intense hurricanes that carry higher wind speeds and more precipitation as a result of global warming.”.

Hurricane Sally reportedly dropped 30 inches of rain in some places, which combined with the storm surge caused heavy flooding in coastal communities..

Central Gulf Coast Bishop Russell Kendrick spent Sept. 18 traveling to some of the churches in his diocese that have been impacted by the hurricane..

The diocese also was hit hard in October 2018 by Hurricane Michael, which made landfall farther east, near Panama City..

“Each storm leaves its own legacy,” Kendrick said in an emailed statement to Episcopal News Service..

“Hurricane Sally really caught us off guard by the direction she took..

Thankfully, while there is significant damage, the folks who live in this area are resilient and hopeful.”.

The diocese is working with Episcopal Relief & Development to assist residents and business owners who are dealing with severe damage to their homes and businesses..

Camp Beckwith, meanwhile, shared photos on Facebook showing trees downed by the storm, including one that hit a camp building..

In Pensacola, the storm knocked out power and phone service at Holy Cross Episcopal Church, according to a Sept. 17 YouTube update from the Rev. Rob Dixon, Holy Cross’ rector..

Dixon offered encouragement to parishioners and asked them to let him know their needs and the needs of others in the community so the congregation could help coordinate assistance with the recovery..

I do want to encourage you all to join me right now in just taking a breath,” he said..

Dixon also invited them – while still following COVID-19 precautions – to gather with him at 9 a.m. Sept. 20 outside the church for a brief prayer..

Afterward, they will work together to clear debris from the parish property..

“After Sunday, what we’re going to have is a plan for next week, for how we can be together the hands and feet of Christ for one another and our neighbors,” he said, “together how we can slowly and fa.

Hurricane Sally inflicts wind, water damage at NAS Pensacola; Florida Guard aiding aftermath.

The effects of Hurricane Sally were still being felt across the Northern Gulf states on Friday, as military and civilian crews worked to assess and repair the damage..

The Category 2 hurricane hit Gulf Shores, Alabama, some 30 miles southwest of Naval Air Station Pensacola, Wednesday morning with 105-mph winds, AccuWeather reported..

The air station sustained some wind and rain destruction, with downed trees and many of its structures succumbing to water leaks..

The base is currently conducting further damage assessments..

“We’re very fortunate,” said Jason Bortz, public affairs officer for the base, in a phone call with Military Times on Friday..

Parts of the base have power and crews are working to restore electricity to others..

As of Friday, almost 369,000 people in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and some parts of Georgia were still without power..

“We’re happy we were able to get the galley up and operational,” Bortz said..

“There are several thousand students here and they spent a night eating MREs, so they’re sure happy about it.”.

Bortz wanted to thank the local community for assisting the base, which doesn’t have the resources other installations have to assist its community with any search and rescue efforts..

“Pensacola isn’t new to catastrophe and has always been great,” Bortz said..

“The Red Cross was out here handing out sandwiches..

In the aftermath of Hurricane Sally, some 500 Guard soldiers and airmen were deployed to help local authorities evacuate 113 people, the Associated Press reported..

On Friday, some 35 people were reportedly rescued by guardsmen with high-water trucks in areas surrounding Mobile, Alabama..

Keesler Air Force Base, near Biloxi, Mississippi, didn’t sustain any significant damage, a spokesperson with the 81st Training Wing told Military Times on Friday..

“We have a marina here and couple of boards broke loose, but Sally almost completely missed us,” said Maj. Joshua Daniels, chief of public affairs, during a phone call..

“We were really prepared, but no real issue happened here.”.

Daniels cited the Keesler’s COVID-19 protocols for helping the base continue its training in adverse environments where social distancing is a necessity..

“Even though we sheltered in place, our students were able to continue to learn.”.

The 81st facilitates a majority of the technical training in the Air Force and does weather training for the entire Department of Defense..

The Air Force base also hosts the 403rd Wing and the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, also known as the “Hurricane Hunters.”.

Bay County Pier already repaired and open to the public after damage from storm.

BAY COUNTY, Fla. (WMBB)–As Hurricane Sally tore through the Gulf, the waves could be seen crashing on the Bay County pier all day long..

As we first reported on Wednesday, the rough surf caused the wooden planks on the end of the pier to detach and fly off..

The pier has already been restored and was reopened to the public..

Bay County staff say the pier is actually designed to break in the areas it did during rough surf..

“This pier was modeled after one that in Pensacola in 2004 that had hurricane damage but it was really minor..

And they noticed that the breakaway panels which every body saw blow up in the video yesterday keep it from pulling up on the concrete structure by just letting it break free,” said Travis Barbee, Bay.

Barbee says replacing the planks was fairly easy and the county was able to fully reopen the pier by 8:00 a.m. Thursday morning..

He says they already had the replacement planks on hand and Panama City Beach even lent them one..

Hurricane Sally cripples Florida, Alabama - leaves thousands without electricity.

The climatic disorder began as a tropical storm and made landfall as a Category 2 Hurricane Sally..

It brought with it unbelievable rainfall in Pensacola in just four hours..

The excessive rainfall devastated the region across Southern states..

Many areas lay submerged under floodwaters while rivers were reported to be approaching dangerous levels..

There were curfews clamped in places to ensure safety of the residents..

As an official of Escambia County, Florida, clarified - "We are still in an evaluation and lifesaving recovery mission, and we need to be able to do that job.”.

Pensacola, Florida, has already recorded 2 feet of rain this morning from Hurricane Sally, according to a preliminary National Weather Service report https://t.co/uylUwY9VYD pic.twitter.com/tY0ZPpBUIu.

Hurricane Sally might have links to climate change,  The Trump administration is aware of the storm that is battering the Gulf Coast..

Sally is downgraded from a Category 2 hurricane to a Category 1..

However, the threat of flooding from heavy rain remains..

The wind speed of the hurricane is 80mph and it is moving in a north-northeasterly direction at 5mph..

The BBC says - in the opinion of experts, the pace of Hurricane Sally could have links to climate change..

Climate is an unpredictable entity and in view of global warming, the frequency of climatic disorders like typhoons, hurricanes, floods have increased..

These disrupt lives, damage properties and infrastructure and create an ecological imbalance..

Rescuers with high-water vehicles have been rescuing people on the Gulf Coast cut off by floodwaters after Hurricane Sally..

Crews were pulling people out of flooded areas Thursday near Pensacola, Florida, while Alabama National Guard troops helped people evacuate near Mobile Bay..

Hurricane Sally Slams Alabama, Farmers Predict Major Crop Losses.

Marlee Moore  (334) 830-1053  Slow-moving Hurricane Sally stalled for hours along Alabama’s Gulf Coast Sept. 16, her creeping progress flooding fields — and farmers’ hopes for bumper harvests..

“It started blowing high winds about 3 a.m. and didn’t stop till mid-morning..

It was a beating,” said Eric Street, who farms near Fairhope with his brother, Tobin..

If you farm in Baldwin County, you know it’s coming.”.

Before the Category 2 storm brought 100-plus mph winds and over 20 inches of rain to the Gulf Coast, Street was optimistic about his crops..

“We felt like we had a great crop of cotton, an awesome crop of peanuts and one of our best crops of soybeans,” said Street, who serves on the Alabama Farmers Federation State Soybean Committee..

“I think there will be something we can harvest, but I don’t know about its quality..

This is why we buy crop insurance and why we bought the new hurricane protection insurance.”.

Street’s cotton crop took a beating from the hurricane, evidenced by tangled, flattened plants and cracked bolls..

“It creates a biological stress where the bolls won’t open properly..

The quality will be less because they won’t mature properly.”.

Farther east in Lillian, pecans popped underfoot as Todd Cassebaum surveyed massive, overturned decades-old trees in his family’s orchard..

He predicted it would have been his best crop in years..

“Years’ worth of work is devastated,” said Cassebaum, who farms with his wife, Hope, the Baldwin County Farmers Federation president..

A concrete irrigation pivot foundation ripped from the soil told a similar story at Mark Kaiser’s farm in Seminole..

“This storm just caught everyone off guard,” said Kaiser, the Federation’s District 12 director..

“We knew once it slowed like that we were in trouble..

There’s a certain amount of prep you can do but only so much time.”.

Across Mobile Bay in Semmes, his family’s Martin’s Nursery uncovered greenhouses in preparation for the storm..

“If a bunch of wind is coming and we know it, we need to uncover the plastic,” Turk said..

“If the wind catches it, it can tear the whole greenhouse down..

Since we knew something was coming, we uncovered what we could..

It’s hard enough to get ready with enough heads up, much less with a day’s notice.”.

Forecasters originally predicted the storm would make landfall along the Louisiana coast, but as it churned for an extended period in the Gulf, it slowly turned east, making landfall in Alabama — 16 y.

For nursery growers, Turk said Sally’s heavy rain before its high winds was a blessing, as rain-soaked potted plants are harder to topple..

Fortunately, his family’s nursery got power back the day after the storm, while neighbors in Baldwin County could be without power for weeks..

Snapped power poles and downed lines were common throughout much of Baldwin County..

Mobile County Farmers Federation President Art Sessions said pecan and cotton crops appear to have taken the worst hit in his county..

Damage to peanuts, soybeans and nursery crops may not show up for days, he said..

Street, Cassebaum, Kaiser and Sessions said they were thankful they purchased additional hurricane crop insurance implemented by USDA’s Risk Management Agency this year..

Farmers farther inland and across south Alabama felt Sally’s wrath as well..

The storm dumped record amounts of rain there, causing extensive damage to crops, pond dams and roadways..

Additional help to farmers and homeowners came in the form of extra Alfa Insurance adjusters and agents deployed to help customers impacted by Hurricane Sally..

“Alfa Insurance’s hometown adjusters and agents were checking on customers and taking claims as soon as the storm moved out,” said Alfa Insurance President Jimmy Parnell, also president of the Alabama.

“As of Friday morning, the company had received more than 1,600 claims across Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi..

An additional 18 claims adjusters from north Alabama were being deployed to help process claims in the southern part of the state.”.

Back near the Florida line in Seminole, Kaiser’s soybeans took a beating, with tiny wind-torn holes peppering the leaves..

Choctawhatchee River water levels lowering heading into the weekend.

GENEVA, Ala. (WDHN) — The Choctawhatchee river runs through Robert Fowler Park leaving the junction area submerged in water after the effects of Hurricane Sally..

You normally can see the road and the river but as of now, that’s not the case as it all looks like a giant lake..

“Well, it’s usually not as high as the water and you can see all the way back to the road and not a lot of water..

Speaking of a lot of water, if that’s not enough it’s expected to rise..

“We’re gonna be rising, now we’re at 25, 28, 30 we’re continually rising tonight, and into to tomorrow into Saturday,” Geneva County EMA Director Eric Johnson said..

According to Johnson, its been at least two decades since Geneva has seen such a big flood..

“In 94 we had worse so 90 and 94 were worst than what you’re seeing today..

I think we had time since then maybe 98 or maybe the end of the 2000s..

So you probably seeing today the fourth-worst situation we had in Geneva,” Johnson said..

Earlier, officials expected the water levels to reach up to about 35 feet but now the chances are a bit lower..

It’s looking like our levels are lowering instead of higher so that’s a good thing..

Johnson says if you are living in low lying areas you need to act now and evacuate because Saturday it will be too late..

He also strongly encourages you to stay away from trying to sightsee the flooded areas..

Governor DeSantis discusses Hurricane Sally Damage.

BAY COUNTY Fla. (WMBB) — Florida Governor Ron DeSantis traveled to survey storm damage left behind by Hurricane Sally..

Governor DeSantis assessed the damage left behind by Hurricane Sally, but he does not think we have seen the end of Sally’s impact, and Floridians need to be prepared..

“Water is still a risk even if we see it recede,” said Governor Desantis..

“We do think, throughout Northwest Florida, you are going to see rising rivers and streams in these bodies of water as rain makes it through the southeast and starts to trickle down here so those may .

Floridians need to keep their guard up, DeSantis said..

“Continue to remain vigilant because we are going to see more water events over the next few days,” Desantis said..

When it comes to those still recovering from Hurricane Michael, DeSantis said it is frustrating to need to clean up once again..

“With Michael, that developed into a category five very quickly,” said Desantis..

Obviously it did a lot of damage but if Sally had been going at Michael’s speed, it would have probably dropped a third of the rain it ended up dropping..

DeSantis said debris clean up from sally might not be as heavy as Hurricane Michael..

“We understand that once the storm passes, in some ways that are just the beginning,” said DeSantis  Governor DeSantis said he looks forward to continuing to assist those needing help in the Pensacola.

One million gallons of raw sewage in Lynn Haven Bayou.

LYNN HAVEN Fla. (WMBB) — More than one million gallons of raw sewage was released into Lynn Haven Bayou and Anderson Bayou due to Hurricane Sally’s flooding..

This sewage spill into the bayous brings along health concerns due to bacteria..

This sewage came up from man-holes and flowed into both these bayous..

Craig Kidwell with the city of Lynn Haven Public Utilities said, for now, do not go swimming in this water, but they will continue to sample the water..

“The area that bay county gets their water from is actually on the other side of deer point dam so there is no way that that could cross-contaminate with this event,” said Kidwell..

“It would take a major major storm for any of that to be affected.”.

Kidwell said it is not just the bayous that are affected, but also street flooding..

Joe Scully, Bay County Health Department environmental supervisor..

He advises even if you are cleaning your house due to flooding inside, make sure to clean your clothes and hands often and do not let your children or pets play in the water..

“So if they ingest the water, the lower side effects could be something like food poisoning, gastrointestinal distress, diarrhea, or vomiting,” said Scully..

“If you have open cuts or wounds they could become infected..

Scully said there is no saying how long this advisory will be in effect, but the city will continue to sample the bayous..

Share:  Although Sally continues to weaken as it moves through the Southeastern US, the threat of flooding rainfall and isolated severe weather stormns remain possible across the Carolinas and Virgini.

Sally was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone Thursday morning and the final advisory on the storm was issued Thursday night..

At that time, Sally had sustained winds around 25 mph and was moving northeast at 15 mph..

Sally officially made landfall early Wednesday morning near Gulf Shores, Alabama..

At that time, Sally was a category 2 hurricane with wind speeds of 105 mph..

WeatherNation meteorologist Meredith Garofalo takes a look back at the damage Hurricane Sally has caused along the Gulf Coast..

**SALLY LATEST** It's been a long last three days with Sally across the Gulf Coast, we take a look at some of the many hazards from storm surge to flooding to damaging winds before, during, and after .

Gusts above 90 mph were recorded in the Florida Panhandle..

Flooding has been a widespread problem with Sally as rich, tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico pushed ashore with the storm..

Coupled with the slow movement of Sally, heavy rainfall was persistent for more than 24 hours..

Some areas saw more than 2 feet of rain along the Alabama and Florida Panhandle coasts..

Heavy rain is tapering off across North and South Carolina into Virginia, though pockets of heavier rain are possible..

Rough surf, high seas and rip currents may occur up and down the Atlantic Seaboard into the weekend..

Coastal flooding will remain a concern over the next couple of days along the Eastern Seaboard with high water levels from a persistent onshore flow..

Wilfred Expected to Form in Gulf Today, Hurricane Teddy Now Category 4.

Sally has moved on, but a pair of storms are hot on her heels, as Tropical Depression 22 is expected to form into Tropical Storm Wilfred in the Gulf today, while Hurricane Teddy strength into a Catego.

Tropical Storm Sally has weakened to a post-tropical cyclone and has moved eastward off the coast of North Carolina and back into the Atlantic..

Tropical storm Wilfred expected to form on Friday  The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is predicting that tropical depression 22 will strengthen into tropical storm Wilfred on Friday in the southweste.

The current forecast track puts the storm strengthening to a hurricane by Sunday, then somewhere near the southeastern coast of Texas coast by next Tuesday, having weekend back into a tropical storm..

Wilfred is the final name on the 2020 storm list for the Atlantic hurricane season..

If additional storms reach “named” status, the names will be derived from the Greek alphabet..

The only previous time this happened in history was in 2005, which saw a record-setting number of named storms..

Hurricane Teddy becomes a major category 4 storm  Hurricane Teddy strengthened in the Atlantic on Friday into a major Category 4 storm with sustained winds reaching 130 mph, WESH reported..

As of 5 AM ET on Friday, Teddy was roughly 935 miles southeast of Bermuda, moving northwest at 12 mph, WFLA reported..

Over the weekend, Teddy is expected to approach Bermuda, making its closest approach to the island either on Sunday or Monday..

The storm is already creating large swells that are expected to increase the threat of rip currents across the Western Atlantic, WFLA reported..

Forecasters said that over the weekend, the swells are expected to extend westward to the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States..

One forecast track shows Teddy making direct hit on Halifax  While it is still too early to determine the exact path of Teddy, one forecast model shows the storm making a direct hit on Halifax, Canada.

Peak hurricane season is here, get prepared  We are currently in the peak of hurricane season, one that could break records for activity..

Don’t expect that all hurricanes are going to strike the southern latitudes of the US..

Hurricanes could affect northern latitudes  Hurricane Teddy is on a track that could take it toward northern latitudes..

If you live in an area that can be affected by hurricanes you should start getting prepared now by having an emergency plan and getting the supplies you need..

The first thing you need to do is to make sure you have an emergency weather radio that runs on batteries and/or a hand crank and/or solar so that it will work regardless of power outages..

It’s easy to find one with all three power options..

Weather radios connect directly to the NOAA to keep you informed..

Start with planning and preparing your evacuation and communications strategy..

Search for the best cell phone plan deals near me and make sure that every member of your family has a cell phone so that you can stay in contact should you get separated..

Make sure that you have and maintain an emergency kit that contains at least a 3 day supply of food and water for you, your family, and pets..

Also make sure you have a flashlight (separate from your cell phone, to save its battery) and backup battery chargers for your cell phone and more..

Make it a weekly routine check and update your supply kit, rotating fresh food and water..

The best source of information with everything you need to know about getting prepared for a hurricane can be found at the National Hurricane Center preparedness page..

As wildfires rage in the West, Hurricane Sally dumps rain across the Southeastern U.S., and drought grows in much of the country, disaster preparation – and relief spending – is once again in the spot.

While the coronavirus is an extraordinary event that has led to an extraordinary response, we sadly know natural disasters will occur and climate change means they are going to be more intense..

The country needs to better prepare, mitigate, adapt, and pre-spond to future disasters..

That means tough public policy choices to disincentivize bad private decisions..

Response funding should reduce future impacts from similar disasters..

To be clear, there is a legitimate federal role in responding when events exceed any single state’s ability to deal with natural disasters and emergencies..

But that also means that states need to help themselves – and federal taxpayers – out by mitigating risk through better planning and building decisions..

One response area that has improved in recent years is budgeting for disaster..

The Budget Control Act of 2011 ushered in an important reform..

For years lawmakers low-balled the Disaster Relief Fund budget – the account used to immediately respond to disaster – knowing that emergency funding would come quickly after disaster struck..

The BCA swept away this bit of budgeting fiction by requiring the DRF to be funded annually at the amount of the average of disaster spending over the previous ten years (high and low years thrown out.

Not exact, but a good proxy and excess funding in any given year would be there for future years..

Starting in Fiscal Year 2020 wildfire funding got a similar treatment with an additional more than $2 billion available if costs exceeded the $1 billion provided for it annually..

Previously, the Forest Service would raid other accounts intended for wildfire mitigation..

While the President rails against the state for California wildfires, he should look in the mirror..

The fact is the majority of forest land in California (and other western states) is federal..

And not surprisingly the majority of acres burned is federal..

But funding for projects that mitigate such as invasive species programs and watershed restoration have been raided for years..

In addition, federal aid should work in concert with state and local programs to mitigate fire risk at the local level including better zoning and fireproofing measures and assistance to people to rel.

On the other side of the spectrum is the existing ag safety net, which seems to expand without strings attached..

Of the many federal subsidies for the agriculture sector, the federal crop insurance program is the most expensive and was established to prevent the instability and unpredictability of relying on ann.

Okay, we have our criticisms and it could be better structured, but okay..

But then the small number of irresponsible farmers that chose to not buy federally subsidized crop insurance were rewarded when Congress appropriated $5.4 billion in ad-hoc assistance for ag losses fr.

This despite the vast majority of acreage in the areas affected by the disasters being covered by crop insurance..

It would be ridiculous for casinos to reward gamblers for making a bad bet..

We cannot reward farmers and ranchers for making a bad bet by not purchasing crop insurance, especially for a program that historically pays out..

Not to worry, for farm businesses that did have crop insurance, USDA delivered “top up” payments in addition..

And there are increased calls for assistance to farmers and ranchers affected by the derecho in Iowa, where 90 percent of their corn and soybean acres are insured..

Amid all this, there isn’t enough mitigation funding to prevent the predictable when communities are encouraged to farm or build where they shouldn’t..

We know that for every dollar spent, mitigation saves six dollars or more on disaster response..

And yet, this short-sightedness on a federal level is as true for picturesque fire traps in California canyons as it is for flood plains in Florida..

Federal policies need to disincentivize behaviors that essentially create manmade disasters and stop over-insulating people and communities from the risks they face..

Especially with climate change intensifying and extending weather events – the 2020 hurricane season already has only one name left on the list before it turns to the Greek alphabet, even though we’re.

Congress currently finds itself in the unenviable position of needing to separate legitimate unmet needs from cynical subsidy seekers in any future emergency disaster spending bill..

Because, we’ll say it again, Congress needs to roll up its sleeves and do the hard work..

Make the tough decisions, think ahead, budget properly, and mitigate risk so that we’re not always responding to a predictably bad outcome..

Anything less is fiscally irresponsible and, as the headlines have shown in bold face this summer, immeasurably devastating to the people living out the consequences..

PANAMA CITY, Fla. (WMBB) — There are several state road and bridge closures and ristrictions in Northwest Florida due to Hurricane Sally..

Escambia County  — Pensacola International Airport has suspended operations for all arriving and departing commercial aircraft..

— The Pensacola Bay Bridge on U.S. 98 is closed to all traffic..

Jackson County  — S.R. 166 (Caverns Road) from Russell Road to S.R. 71 is closed due to flooding..

Santa Rosa County  — Garcon Point Bridge (S.R. 281) is open, limited to two-axle vehicles..

— The outside eastbound lane of U.S. 90 from the Escambia County line to Bass Hole Cove Bridge is closed due to shoulder erosion..

— S.R. 89 is closed at the Alabama state line due to roadway damage in Alabama..

Washington County  — S.R. 277 from Pioneer Road to Bonnett Pond Road is closed due to flooding..

The Florida Department of Transportation encourages motorists to monitor weather reports and road conditions and to be on the lookout for flooded roads..

FDOT advises if the road ahead is flooded, turn around and find an alternate route..

Flooded roads may hide the fact that the roadway is washed out underneath and as little as six inches of rushing water can force you off the road..

Local EMC crews head out to help in wake of Hurricane Sally.

Walton, Gwinnett and surrounding counties may not be on the coast, but that has not prevented Hurricane Sally from having an impact on the area..

From flooded rivers, downed trees and power outages, to local EMC crews heading out to help other areas impacted, residents in the local area have also felt the wrath of Sally..

And sadly, Snellville lost a resident when a tree came down in her neighborhood..

But weather has improved, albeit cooler than prior to the storm, and local clean up is under control..

While there was some flooding, trees down and power outages, it was nothing like the coast of Florida and Alabama experienced and some local crews from Walton EMC are heading out to help with power re.

“We’re sending crews to Baldwin EMC in Summerdale, AL near Mobile..

Baldwin has 100 percent of their meters out,” said Greg Brooks from Walton EMC..

He quoted from from the Balwin EMC Facebook page, “Up to 1,600 additional crews are on the way to assist, in addition to the 100 that arrived yesterday..

We’re looking at prolonged, extensive outages due to the amount of damage..

We don’t want to sugar coat this; we’re in it for the long haul.”.

Crews from Walton EMC assisted in the restoration of power to Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Laura..

Photo credit: Walton EMC  At the moment, Walton EMC still has crews in Jennings, La. rebuilding Jeff Davis Electric Co-op after Hurricane Laura..

“They were hit very hard and it may be weeks before power to everyone is restored,” Brooks said..

Those crews from Walton EMC in Louisiana are returning Saturday..

Brian Thompson, Monroe’s electric and telecommunications director, said at this time they have not received any requests to send crews to help, but that could change..

“As of now we have not received any request for help from APPA (American Public Power Association) or ECG (Electric Cities of Georgia),” Thompson said..

“We do have mutual aid agreements with both and have spent many days restoring power to damaged areas all over the southeast.”.

Sally from satellite: Images from space show devastation in Alabama.

ORANGE BEACH, Ala. (CBS NEWSPATH) — Satellite imagery, shot before and after Hurricane Sally struck Alabama towns, reveal the level of damages..

Satellite company Maxar Technologies released on Thursday (September 17) comparison images of buildings and areas affected by the storm around Gulf Shores and Fort Morgan peninsula in Alabama..

Sally struck Gulf Shores, Alabama, early Wednesday (September 16) with winds of 105 miles per hour, killing one person..

Remnants of the storm continued with flash flooding, dumping more than a foot of rain over the U.S. Southeast on Thursday..

Sally was the 18th named storm in the Atlantic this year and the eighth of tropical storm of hurricane strength to hit the United States..

‘The scariest adventure:’ Riding out Hurricane Sally.

Those who rode out Hurricane Sally on Dauphin Island say that in some ways it was comparable to Ivan, for its course, or Danny, for its rains, or even Frederic, for the damage to trees and power lines.

But three longtime island residents who shared their stories with AL.com say it was like nothing else they’ve ever experienced..

‘The scariest adventure I’ve ever been in’  Dauphin Island resident Pat Edwards knows the exact moment when riding out Hurricane Sally started to look like a questionable decision, and it happened lon.

Edwards, 79, and her husband Bill, 86, bought property on the island in 1983 and moved there from Toledo, Ohio, in 1989..

Their house is at the end of Delchamps Avenue, on a little spit of land that bows into a body of water called Dauphin Island Bay..

The point their house is on, combined with another jutting up from the South, create a passage to a smaller body of water called Indian Bay..

The Dauphin Island Marina is just around the corner..

Their home is encrusted with propellers, anchors and other nautical hardware the couple collected in the past when they were active divers..

From her deck, Edwards has a fine view to the east across Dauphin Island Bay, which is sheltered from the swells of Mobile Bay by an undeveloped slice of sand known as Little Dauphin Island..

Edwards said that as she looked east on Tuesday afternoon, she saw the southeast tip of Little Dauphin Island crumbling away..

There’d been a pass there, but it was indirect: From her vantage point, boats had to hook to the right and out of sight in order to leave the small bay for open water..

“When that breached, the waves in here went from three feet to about 10 feet,” she said..

Most of her next door neighbor’s dock was ripped away by a single wave..

Across the pass into Indian Bay, she could see houses on DeSoto Drive losing their docks..

She thinks the breach also contributed to extensive destruction at the marina around the corner..

As she spoke on Thursday, the new gap to the east allowed a view across the mouth of the bay to the Fort Morgan peninsula in the distance..

On Monday, she hadn’t been able to see that, Edwards said..

The couple, who’d bugged out for Ivan and Katrina, had opted to stay home for this one..

Roll-down hurricane shutters protected their windows and they were glad to have them: Neighbors who didn’t have shutters in place said they’d had water coming in past their window seals and could see .

But the shutters made it dark, which added to the uncertainty..

“It was the scariest adventure I’ve ever been in,” she said..

She watched the wind speed reported by a weather station mounted on a metal pole outside..

“For three hours it went from 90 to 83, 90 to 83,” she said..

When she ventured out the next morning, she found that the pole had bent..

Signs of the storm mostly consisted of missing siding and signs of roof damage here and there..

Edwards said it was deceptive: Houses that looked fine on the south side had substantial damage on the north side, in some cases..

The cleanup hadn’t been bad compared to Ivan, she said..

As that storm had moved east its north winds had pushed water out of Mobile Bay and across her part of Dauphin Island..

That flood carried manmade debris as well as vegetation full of rodents and worse..

“We found five cottonmouths under the house,” she said..

There was a truckload of other people’s furniture by her pool, and a 40-foot sailboat had come to rest under the house..

But riding it out isn’t an experience Edwards cares to repeat..

‘My island is hurting right now’  There was a point in the night when it sounded like bullets were hitting the house..

Carol Patronas Ball knew Hurricane Sally was stripping the pecans off her tree..

“I don’t think we were prepared for the intensity,” she said Thursday, looking back on the experience of riding out the storm..

“When I saw the pressure I couldn’t believe what the wind speeds were.”.

She’s the daughter of Billy Patronas, who was mayor of the town of Dauphin Island until his death in 1997..

“I left for Frederic in ’79 and Elena in ’85,” she said..

If anything’s at 80 miles per hour and a hundred miles from us in the Gulf, I’m leaving..

He stayed during Katrina and he said this was worse.”.

Ball said she’s finished most of her preparations on Monday..

When the storm slowed down, that made time on Tuesday for to take care of a few final tasks and to help friends and neighbors to the same..

“I think God protects us by bringing storms in at night so we don’t go out and try to fix what we see is wrong..

And I believe that’s why most storms come in at night..

Because if you can see what’s going on, you’re going to want to do something about it.”.

At one point her husband shined a flashlight into the yard and saw that a channel marker used as a lawn ornament by a neighbor was now in their yard..

They texted the neighbor to say they had it but didn’t know if it was going to stop there..

“It got to the point to where the cell phone was dying,” she said..

“It was too bad to go out and charge it, I wasn’t even going to go the 10 steps to my car..

So I just closed my eyes and fell asleep sitting up on the couch.”.

We probably can’t see it right now, but good will come of it..

Carol Patronas Ball  “It was heartbreaking, the devastation,” she said..

The extensive tree damage and pervasive power outages remind her of Frederic, she said..

But Frederic had destroyed the bridge and power lines to the mainland..

It took six months to get power re-established after that storm..

Finding out that Sally hadn’t damaged the bridge or causeway to the island was a blessing this time around, she said..

“Being from here, my island is hurting right now,” she said..

She was also heartened to hear reports that people all around the country, who’d vacationed on the island, were offering to send relief support..

“From what I’ve seen, most of the damage is on the north side of the structures,” she said..

“Everything looks fine from the road, but you go, you get out and you walk around and the back side is destroyed.”.

“Being from here, you always want to stay in your home, but there may not be a next time for me to stay in my home,” she said..

“I think some that stayed, that haven’t had any experiences like this, I don’t think they’re going to do it again.”.

On Thursday, Ball was still running on adrenaline..

“I’ve had 9 hours of sleep since Sunday night, I think,” she said..

It’s going to have to be replaced but it’s not like it’s down to the plywood..

“I think I’m going to go across the bridge tonight and wash some clothes and take a hot shower,” she said..

A cousin’s family had power and the air conditioning was on..

“He’s got it set on 68 degrees,” Ball said with a gleam in her eye, “and I’m ready.”.

‘If you respect Mother Nature, it’s not a problem'  Jack L. Gaines II is a contrary case..

He evacuated his home on Dauphin Island only to ride out the storm in his truck..

In contrast to those who’ve had all the hurricane they care to experience, he’s put a Category 5 on his bucket list..

Gaines spent a portion of his Tuesday evening parked at Dauphin Island Marina, watching the piers come apart in the glare of his Suburban’s headlights, watching as a few boats bashed around in the wre.

He revisited the spot on Thursday afternoon to mull over the experience..

He’s lived on the island his whole life, amassing the experience that shaped his response to Sally..

“When I was a child, when I was six years old, I was in Grand Bay for Camille,” he said..

“A piece of sheet metal came off my grandparents' house and cut a limb, eight or 10 inches in diameter, off a pecan tree..

If it had hit a person, it wouldn’t have slowed down..

It went through that limb and embedded in the trunk of the tree.”.

Now 56, he’s had a captain’s license since he was 24..

Being a boat owner has shaped his storm response over the years: He’s ridden out smaller storms, but taken the boats elsewhere whenever it looked like the island might take a hard hit..

But he’s been gradually reconsidering that strategy..

Gaines was free to do things a little differently..

That started with leaving his home on the west end early Tuesday..

“I’ll tell you, I was shutting the door watching waves starting to come across the boulevard..

I’ve lived down there 20 years and the tide came up a little quicker than I thought it would..

I’m glad I left, because at 8:30 my big nasty Suburban probably would have made it out, but I’m not sure.”.

At that point most people would have kept on going right off the island, or at least holed up with friends..

At 10:30 p.m., when most had battened down for the duration, he and some buddies in another vehicle were shining their headlights out on the marina..

20 Hurricane Sally damage at Dauphin Island  From there, he moved around..

Part of the time he parked in a resort’s parking garage for shelter, part of it he patrolled..

Mindful of the lesson that piece of sheet metal showed him in Camille, he charted a path that kept him close to any available shelter..

As the night went on, his range of motion was limited..

“I wanted to see if I could get to my boats and check them,” he said..

By 3:30 he was back at the marina, headlights again shining across the wreckage..

Damage and sunken boats at Dauphin Island due to Hurricane Sally Posted by al.com on Wednesday, September 16, 2020  “There’s a good fetch right there,” he said of the open expanse of Dauphin Island Ba.

It started to clock around, the storm went east of us instead of coming across from the west.”.

“If it didn’t make that jog at the last minute … We’d have lost a lot of houses,” he said..

He’s been pleased to see people already starting cleanup and repair..

“This isn’t like other groups that wait for somebody to help them,” he said..

You’ve got to go ahead and start picking up the pieces now.”.

He figures he’ll get into cleanup and recovery work in the near term..

But it seems Sally was a turning point for him, and in the longer term he’s more interested than ever in riding out a big one..

“But I learned that I could weather then to probably a Category 3, where I’m at..

“It’s nice to do it here on Dauphin Island,” he said..

But on the other hand, I don’t want to see a bigger storm on the island.”.

“If you respect Mother Nature, it’s not a problem,” he said..

“As a young person I tempted her a few times and learned she’ll bite you real quick..

I see where I can do something, and I’ll take that risk, but if it doesn’t look safe, I won’t do it..

Hurricane Sally Hits Hard, AG Churches Spared -- So Far.

E-mail address  Message This  Southern Alabama and the western panhandle of Florida bore the brunt of Hurricane Sally when it hit on Wednesday..

The storm made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of 105 mph and dumped up to 30 inches of rain..

There have been no reports of any AG churches experiencing significant damage due to the storm, but as rivers drain, that could change..

According to Vint Norris, director of the Alabama District Council Disaster Response, although some Alabama AG churches experienced minor structural damage, he is not aware of any churches with signif.

However, he adds that many communities were hard hit..

“There are tons of downed trees and debris and many people without power, so we’re coordinating relief teams, debris teams, to go in and help with the clean-up,” Norris states..

“Orange Beach was hit hard, but The Island Church (Fred Franks, pastor) only had minor damage..

Convoy of Hope is already on the ground at Fred Franks’ church.”.

Norris says that the district will begin its efforts by serving churches and their communities in Loxley, Summerdale, Foley, and Orange Beach..

“We’re bringing in all kinds of supplies and generators and bringing a truck load of ice to Orange Beach,” Norris says..

Teams interested in assisting as part of debris removal teams or in other capacities should contact Norris at 251-209-2818..

West Florida District Council Superintendent Tommy Moore says that to this point no churches in the district have reported significant damages, but there is major flooding in the district as I-10 and .

“We had 15 to 30 inches of rain in the west part of the district,” Moore says..

“The problem is, rivers in Alabama and Georgia drain through here, and that will create a second round of river flooding over the next five days.”.

Moore says the district is organizing teams to help AG churches minister to their communities and assist Convoy of Hope and other relief organizations in the distribution of supplies..

Teams that want to volunteer to assist should contact Bill Mayo at the district office: 850-482-2986..

“We’re thankful for things going as well as they are,” Moore says, “and, once again (in reference to Category 5 Hurricane Michael that hit the panhandle in 2018), we’ll be picking up the pieces and mo.

‘We want to stand with you:’ Gov. Ivey, state officials give update on Hurricane Sally recovery on Dauphin Island.

DAUPHIN ISLAND, Ala. (WKRG) — Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, Sen. Doug Jones and other state officials gave an update on Hurricane Sally recovery on Dauphin Island Friday afternoon..

After surveying the damage from a helicopter, Ivey said, “It’s mighty bad, thank goodness only one life has been lost so far, and our prayers go out to the family.”.

Ivey urged residents to be patient in recovery efforts and to reach out to local officials for help..

“We want to stand with you and are here to be of help to you..

Ivey said the state is working “shoulder-to-shoulder” with local officials in the recovery effort..

She expressed her appreciation for local first responders, deputies, linemen and “countless others.”.

“The people of Alabama are praying for the people of this area..

You are in their thoughts and prayers, and together, if we stand strong and do the very best, we can all get through this,” Ivey said..

Alabama State Sen. Doug Jones said the federal government is here to help and speed up recovery efforts through FEMA..

“I ask folks to remember: It is a lot of damage out there..

This is not going to be something you can always do in a matter of days, a lot of people hurting and needing help,” Jones said..

“We are going to do everything we can to move the process along.”.

Jones said there is a limited number of resources on the city, county, and state levels, and the federal government will assist in the recovery effort..

Everybody is pulling in the same direction,” Jones said..

“The only way we get through this is by pulling together.”.

Brian Hastings, director of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, said he is “very pleased where we are right now” in terms of recovery, and he encouraged volunteer activity to help during this “lo.

Tallahassee International Airport serving as hub for hurricane relief aid.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WTXL) — The Tallahassee International Airport is functioning as a hub to help people with Hurricane Sally relief..

Helicopters gas up and supplies, like generators, food, and water are gathered and shipped where needed..

It's similar to what they did during Hurricane Michael..

The airport says Tallahassee is close enough to work as a transfer spot but far away enough from impact..

"We know they would do the same for us if we were impacted here and it really just highlights the important role that airports play in disaster recovery for not only the community but really the entir.

"So we're just honored to be a part of the recovery phase for Hurricane Sally.".

Durkin expects the operations center to continue for at least the next couple of weeks..

Tropical storm Sally strengthens to Category 2 as it moves toward the US Gulf Coast.

Hurricane Sally gaining strength as it moves toward Gulf Coast  CNN —  Hurricane Sally strengthened into a Category 2 storm on Monday, and there’s a chance it will make landfall in southeastern Louisi.

The center of Sally is expected to move near the southeastern Louisiana coast Monday night and make landfall on the Gulf Coast late on Tuesday, possibly as a Category 3 hurricane, the National Hurrica.

The storm appeared to shift east early Monday, placing Mississippi’s and Alabama’s entire coasts under a hurricane warning..

Hurricane warnings now stretch from Morgan City, Louisiana, eastward into Florida, at the Okaloosa/Walton County line..

Forecasters warn of storm surge and flash flooding..

Luis A. Sanabria puts plywood over windows of a business in the French Quarter in New Orleans..

Joe Raedle/Getty Images  Further strengthening is expected in the next 24 hours before the storm makes landfall, the NHC said..

“Sally could approach major hurricane strength,” the NHC said, adding that the storm’s wind speeds have increased by at least 40 mph in just a 12-hour period, a process called intensification..

A Monday evening update showed the storm about 135 miles southeast of Biloxi, Mississippi..

The storm had 100 mph winds, but of more concern is its sluggish final approach, forecasters say..

“Since Sally is forecast to be moving very slowly around the time of landfall, a slower rate of weakening is indicated since a large portion of the circulation will remain over water for some time,” t.

President Donald Trump approved emergency declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi, the White House said..

This means Trump authorized the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist with all disaster relief efforts in the two states..

Mississippi officials are working to make decisions on possible mandatory evacuations, Gov. Tate Reeves said..

During a briefing, the governor said he feared his state would bear the brunt of Sally’s rain and storm surge, and he urged residents to prepare for prolonged power outages..

Alabama and Mississippi get ready  Officials were handing out sandbags in Saraland, Alabama, north of Mobile, while residents on Dauphin Island, a barrier isle on the Alabama coast, were also preparin.

“We’re lucky enough to live in the center of the island, so it’s not hopefully gonna be too bad for us,” Ryan Gieselman told the station..

“I hope it really just misses us and we can go on with the rest of our summer and enjoy it, but if it hits us, just be prepared and be ready to hunker down.”.

Five cyclones churn in Atlantic Ocean for only second time in history.

For only the second time in recorded history, five tropical cyclones are churning in the Atlantic Ocean at the same time..

Louisiana and Mississippi residents were under evacuation orders on Monday as Hurricane Sally churned across the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening to a hurricane ahead of expected landfall on Tuesday, the.

The second storm in less than a month to threaten the region, Sally was headed toward a slow-motion landfall that could dump damaging rains on the US Gulf coast..

Residents from Louisiana to Florida were told to also expect storm surge and high winds..

Meanwhile the entire island of Bermuda, where homes are built to withstand major hurricanes, was inside the eye of Hurricane Paulette on Monday morning..

The strong category 1 storm arrived hours after the wealthy British territory shuttered schools, government agencies and air and sea ports..

Officials warned of heavy flooding given that the hit coincided with an unusually high tide..

Forecasters said the island would experience hurricane-force winds for roughly seven hours..

Fewer than 10 hurricanes have made direct landfall on the island since the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) began tracking such disasters in the 1850s..

The NHC said Paulette would become a major hurricane by Monday night, after moving away from Bermuda and into open water..

Of the other storms, Rene was forecast to weaken further having ceased to be a tropical storm..

But Teddy became a tropical storm and was expected to become a hurricane later in the week, forecasters said..

At the same time, Tropical Depression 21 formed east of the Cape Verde islands, with the potential to become a tropical storm..

All US Gulf coast states were urging residents to prepare for the arrival of Sally..

“It is likely that this storm system will be impacting Alabama’s Gulf coast,” said the state’s governor, Kay Ivey..

A mandatory evacuation order was issued in Grand Isle, Louisiana, and New Orleans’ mayor, LaToya Cantrell, issued a mandatory evacuation order for residents outside the levee protection system..

Jeffrey Gagnard, a resident of Chalmette, Louisiana, spent Sunday in Mississippi, helping his parents prepare their home for Sally – and making sure they evacuated..

“I mean, after Katrina, anything around here and anything on the water, you’re going to take serious,” he said, referring to the catastrophic hurricane which hit in 2005, as he loaded his SUV with bot.

Forecasters from the NHC in Miami said Sally was expected to reach shore by early Tuesday, bringing dangerous conditions including risk of flooding from the western Florida panhandle to south-east Lou.

“I know for a lot of people this storm seemed to come out of nowhere,” said Louisiana’s governor, John Bel Edwards..

Edwards said many from south-western Louisiana had evacuated from Hurricane Laura into New Orleans – exactly the area that could now be hit by Sally..

“It needs to be understood by all of our friends in the coastal region and in south Mississippi that if you live in low-lying areas, the time to get out is early tomorrow morning,” the governor, Tate .

Sally was moving west-north-west at 8mph on Monday morning..

It was centered 115 miles east-south-east of the mouth of the Mississippi, 165 miles south-east of Biloxi, Mississippi..

On Sunday, Florida’s Gulf coast was battered with windy and wet weather..

Sally could produce up to 24in by the middle of the week, forecasters said..

Its maximum sustained winds on Monday morning were near 65mph..

“That system is forecast to bring not only damaging winds but a dangerous storm surge,” said Daniel Brown of the NHC..

Ivey closes beaches as Hurricane Sally strengthens - Alabama Now.

Gov. Kay Ivey called a state of emergency on Monday and closes beaches as Hurricane Sally strengthened in the Gulf..

“As the recently upgraded Hurricane Sally continues heading closer to the Gulf Coast, we must give individuals time to prepare for the anticipated impacts of this storm,” Ivey said in a statement earl.

“Through a supplemental state of emergency declaration, I am closing all Alabama beaches effective today at 3:00 p.m. and recommending an evacuation, especially of non-residents, and those living in f.

“Alabamians are no stranger to tropical weather and the significant damage these storms can do, even though our state is not currently in the direct line of impact..

Locals will need to prepare their homes, businesses and personal property for imminent storm surge, heavy rain and flash flooding..

… I ask everyone to use their best judgement and practice personal responsibility to ensure safety of themselves, their families and our first responders..

Meanwhile, storm-weary Gulf Coast residents rushed to finish last-minute preparations Monday as Hurricane Sally chugged slowly through warm Gulf waters..

“Everybody’s biggest fear is the storm surge, and the worst possible scenario being that it just stalls out..

The National Hurricane Center said it was too early to tell exactly where Sally would come ashore, because it’s still not known when it would make a turn to the north..

“Because it’s slowing down, it could produce a tremendous amount of rainfall over the coming days.”.

People in New Orleans were watching the storm’s track intently..

The Hurricane Center warned of an “extremely dangerous and life-threatening storm surge” for areas outside the levee protection system that protects the greater New Orleans area stretching from Port F.

“I know for a lot of people this storm seemed to come out of nowhere,” said Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards Sunday..

It was just a little over two weeks ago when the opposite end of the state was bracing for Hurricane Laura, which blew ashore on August 27 as a Category 4 hurricane in Cameron Parish, which borders Te.

On Saturday, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell issued a mandatory evacuation order for Orleans Parish residents living outside the parish’s levee protection system..

The entire island was inside its eye on Monday and many customers lost power, but Bermuda’s buildings are built to withstand bigger hurricanes..

5 tropical cyclones are in the Atlantic at the same time for only the second time in history.

(CNN) It's peak hurricane season, and that's clear when you look at the Atlantic Ocean, which has five active tropical cyclones at the same time for only the second time in history..

The only other time there were five active tropical cyclones -- hurricane, tropical storm and/or tropical depression -- in the Atlantic was in 1971..

For the 2nd time on record, the Atlantic has 5+ tropical cyclones (tropical depression (TD) or stronger) simultaneously: #Hurricane #Paulette , TD #Rene , Tropical Storm #Sally , Tropical Storm #Teddy.

pic.twitter.com/9ET1OoxE6f  Hurricane Paulette made landfall early Monday morning in Bermuda..

While Paulette is currently moving away from Bermuda, hurricane conditions are still impacting the island..

Strong winds, storm surge and very heavy rainfall will likely continue all the way through the afternoon..

"Swells produced by Paulette are affecting portions of Leeward Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and the United States," the National Hurricane Center (NHC) says ..

"These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.".

Paulette is also expected to continue to strengthen as it tracks into the open Atlantic..

The hurricane could gain major hurricane status, with wind speeds of at least 111 mph, on Wednesday..

If this does occur it would only be the second hurricane to achieve this distinction so far this season..

The Atlantic Hurricane Season typically averages three major hurricanes in total..

Tropical Depression Rene, which had once been a tropical storm this past weekend, will continue to weaken as it tracks through the central Atlantic Ocean..

This storm is not expected to impact any land and is also forecast to dissipate within the next two days..

Three storms with very different impacts  Hurricane Sally is currently heading northwest through the Gulf of Mexico..

Mandatory evacuations are already underway for low-lying areas along the Gulf Coast..

As of right now, Sally is forecast to make landfall either Tuesday or Wednesday somewhere near the Louisiana-Mississippi state line..

The average forecast track error from the NHC (48 hours out) is about 80 miles, so it is too early to determine exactly where the center of Sally will hit directly..

The NHC cautions that people along the coast should not focus on the specific details of the track, but rather the overall impact of the storm..

The big takeaway from this storm is the dangerous amount of water..

The NHC is calling for "life-threatening storms surge and flash flooding.".

The highest storm surge is expected to be just to the east of where Sally makes landfall..

Right now the NHC is forecasting 7 to 11 feet of storm surge from the mouth of the Mississippi River east to Ocean Springs, Mississippi, including Lake Borgne..

Rising waters from the surge is expected to be felt as far west as Burns Point, Louisiana, and as far east as Saint Andrews Bay, Florida..

Besides storm surge, extreme amounts of rainfall are also forecast for some locations..

Widespread rainfall totals along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to the panhandle of Florida are forecast to be between 6 to 10 inches; however, some cities could see up to 2 feet of rainfall..

This amount of rainfall will lead to life-threatening flash flooding including major urban and river flooding as well..

Tropical Storm Teddy is currently in the central Atlantic, well over 1,000 miles east of the Lesser Antilles..

Teddy is expected to strengthen to a hurricane over the next few days..

If this occurs, Teddy will be the eighth hurricane of this year's Atlantic Hurricane Season, behind Sally..

Sally became a hurricane Monday, according to a tweet from the NHC  By the end of the week Teddy is forecast to become a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) as it approaches Bermuda..

It is too early to tell at this time whether it will directly hit Bermuda, but given the current track it will be something to watch in the coming days..

Tropical Storm Vicky is currently over the eastern Atlantic, just a few hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands..

Vicky is the earliest 20th Atlantic named storm on record, breaking the previous record set by Tammy on October 5, 2005..

Vicky is expected to encounter unfavorable conditions in the next couple of days, which will limit its growth and intensification by Tuesday..

Still reeling from Hurricane Laura, Gulf Coast braces for Hurricane Sally.

MONROE, La. — The Gulf Coast is looking down the barrel of another violent storm as Category 2 Hurricane Sally churned north, threatening to bring heavy rain, howling winds and a dangerous storm surge.

The hurricane comes less than three weeks after Hurricane Laura carved a wide path of destruction that left more than a third of Louisiana a disaster zone..

“I know for a lot of people, this storm seemed to come out of nowhere,” Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said..

"  The National Hurricane Center said Sally is likely to bring "life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds and flash flooding" along the Gulf Coast..

Sally has weakened slightly, as maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 90 mph, with higher gusts, according to an update from the Hurricane Center early Tuesday morning..

But, the storm is expected to re-strengthen later Tuesday and become a dangerous hurricane when it moves onshore along the north-central Gulf coast..

Sally's center will move near the coast of southeastern Louisiana later today, and make landfall late Tuesday or early Wednesday morning, the Hurricane Center said..

Hour by hour:Hurricane Laura raged outside my front door..

Hurricane warnings are in effect from Grande Isle, Louisiana, to Navarre, Florida, including New Orleans, the Hurricane Center said..

As it lurches over the Gulf Coast, Hurricane Sally could bring 8 to 16 inches of rain, and some areas could see up to two feet..

In addition, this rainfall will likely lead to widespread minor to isolated major flooding on area rivers," forecasters at the Hurricane Center said..

Sally is the seventh hurricane of 2020 Atlantic hurricane season..

Edwards warned people to prepare for the storm immediately..

Louisiana already is sheltering about 13,000 Hurricane Laura evacuees, most of whom are in hotels in New Orleans, which is in the potential path of Sally..

"New Orleans is better prepared for a hurricane than she's ever been before, but if you get 18 inches of water in 10 hours, I think Aspen, Colorado, would probably flood..

So I'm concerned, but not paralyzed by it," Edwards said..

Mayor LaToya Cantrell issued an evacuation order for Orleans Parish residents living outside the parish’s levee protection system, and residents of Grand Isle, Louisiana, were told to evacuate..

"Residents need to take this storm very, very, very seriously," said New Orleans' Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness Director Collin Arnold..

On Twitter on Monday night, President Donald Trump said he was "closely monitoring" the hurricane and "fully engaged" with state and local leaders to assist "the great people of Alabama, Louisiana and.

Tens of thousands were displaced from their homes after Laura..

More than 82,000 people remain without power in Lake Charles and southwestern Louisiana..

More than 210,000 households don't have clean drinking water..

Benjamin Schott, the meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service office in New Orleans, said Louisianans in the southeastern part of the state shouldn't compare Sally to previous storms Ba.

"I do not believe we'll be that lucky this time," Schott said..

More on Laura:'Extraordinary work' underway to rebuild electric, water, cell grid after Hurricane Laura  After Sally makes landfall, it is expected to move slowly over Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.

As of 10 p.m. CDT Monday, Sally had 100-mph winds and was about 130 southeast of Biloxi, Mississippi, according to the Hurricane Center..

In Mississippi, officials warned residents the storm would coincide with high tide and could bring significant storm surge..

Evacuation orders were in effect for Hancock County on Monday morning for residents living in low-lying areas, on or near water sources and in mobile homes..

The Hurricane Center said the area from the mouth of the Mississippi River to Ocean Springs, Mississippi, could see up to 11 feet of storm surge..

Winona "Bebe" McElroy and her husband, Victor, were staying in their home in Cocodrie, Louisiana, outside the levee system Sunday..

Winona McElroy said she didn't expect the weather to get bad until Monday afternoon..

The two brought their two boats to a farm to protect them from the storm..

"We take every storm in the Gulf seriously," she said..

"That's why we're spending our Sunday afternoon taking our boats to safe harbor, inside the levee protection area.".

She said they will monitor the waters and leave if it appears their truck might get trapped by the waters..

"We know at what point the truck can't get out," she said..

South Florida took the early brunt of Sally's power over the weekend..

Nine to 12 inches of rain fell Saturday morning to Sunday morning, prompting a flood advisory in the Keys..

Key West reported a little more than 9 inches at midnight, its fifth-highest daily total..

That included a one-hour total of almost 4 inches Saturday night..

In the Panhandle, “the rain is going to be the main threat, along with the beaches, which will see lots of large, surface-breaking waves and a high risk of rip currents,” said Jack Cullen, a meteorolo.

The Pensacola area can expect to receive 10 to 15 inches of rain and bursts of tropical storm force winds..

For only the second time on record, forecasters said, five tropical cyclones are swirling simultaneously in the Atlantic basin..

Hurricane Paulette is moving away from Bermuda as it makes its way east over the ocean..

The East Coast could see some swells from the storm..

Rene, a tropical depression, is heading southwest, but it's forecast to become a remnant low late Monday..

Tropical Storm Teddy is strengthening as it moves northwest and could be a major hurricane by midweek as it remains far off land northeast of Puerto Rico and southeast of Bermuda..

Tropical Storm Vicki formed Monday in the eastern portion of the Atlantic Ocean..

Vicki, the 20th named storm of the season, is expected to be short-lived and poses no threat to land..

Tropical Storm Sally to Intensify Into a Hurricane; Serious Threat of Storm Surge, Flooding Rain Headed For Gulf Coast.

State of emergency declared ahead of Hurricane Sally.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - Gov. Kay Ivey issued a state of emergency declaration at 6 a.m. Monday, ahead of Tropical Storm Sally’s official designation as a hurricane..

Earlier today, I issued a State of Emergency because those on the Gulf Coast know a flood and heavy rains can be just as deadly as tropical winds," Ivey said. ".

We pray that Sally doesn’t do any harm, but we must be prepared just in case..

As your governor, you have my assurance that every resource will be available] if we need it..

Forecasts call for heavy rain, flooding, storm surge, isolated tornadoes, and damaging winds to the coast..

[READ MORE: Sally strengthening as it heads toward Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama]  Ivey’s declaration activates the state’s Emergency Operations Plan and the Alabama Emergency Management Agency S.

It also notifies state agencies to prepare for the storm and puts the Alabama National Guard on alert for possible activation..

The declaration also allows for a waiver of some federal motor-carrier regulations and puts consumers and businesses on notice that price gouging is illegal..

The governor’s offices also urged that anyone responding to the storm is encouraged to remain vigilant against the spread of COVID-19 and that COVID-19 orders will remain in effect..

“However, any of the COVID-19 orders that would endanger any person affected by this storm or impede the ability to preserve human life, prevent human suffering, or protect critical infrastructure are.

During a phone call with FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor and Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf Monday evening, Ivey asked for that the pre-landfall emergency declaration request be expedited..

“As projections for Hurricane Sally continue to develop, and as Alabama will likely receive significant impact from this system, I have requested a pre-landfall emergency declaration for the state..

I just wrapped up a phone call with Acting DHS Secretary Wolf and FEMA Administrator Gaynor and asked them to expedite this request," Ivey said in a statement. ".

The White House and Trump Administration have been extremely helpful as we have anticipated a potential hit from Sally..

I thank President Trump for being a terrific partner for our state as we make preparations..

My fellow Alabamians, please continue heeding all local warnings and stay weather aware.”.

Sally’s track continues good news trend for local area.

BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - The National Hurricane Center forecast track for Tropical Storm Sally continues to spell good news for the WAFB viewing area..

The eastward (right) shift in projected landfall that began yesterday afternoon continues to hold true..

Sally is forecast to slow down today as it approaches the extreme SE Louisiana Coast late tonight..

Sally could skirt Plaquemines Parish near the mouth of the Mississippi River predawn Tuesday morning before turning due north towards Mississippi..

Sally slows as it approaches and turns north taking the brunt of Sally’s significant impacts into Coastal Mississippi..

First Alert Forecast (WAFB)  Sally remains a lop-sided tropical storm with a majority of convection staying on the East and SE side of its center..

This is expected to remain the case through landfall..

That means Sally’s structure and track will limit impacts across the WAFB local area..

For now metro Baton Rouge remains under a Tropical Storm Warning and Flash Flood Watch..

First Alert Forecast (WAFB)  Storm surge will likely be the greatest issue locally..

Storm surge amounts have come down some along Southern Lafourche Parish..

Surge estimates of 3-5 feet are forecast from Port Fourchon through Grand Isle..

Storm surge of 4-6 feet is forecast within our tidal lakes (Maurepas & Pontchartrain)..

The lower reaches of area rivers (Amite, Tickfaw, Tangipahoa) will continue to see a slow rise until Sally makes landfall..

This rise will keep water from emptying into Lake Maurepas..

Any additional river flooding upstream is not expected based off current rainfall estimates..

First Alert Forecast (WAFB)  Speaking of rainfall amounts, the heaviest rains associated with Sally will be confined close and east of the center..

Sally’s track will take the majority of heavy rain into Mississippi and Alabama..

Significant rainfall totals of 15-20″ will occur in these areas causing major flooding concerns..

The latest outlook from the Weather Prediction Center estimates 0.25″ to 4″ across the local area..

There will be quite a gradient with rains increasing from west to east across WAFB’s viewing area..

First Alert Forecast (WAFB)  Wind impacts also appear minimal for the metro area..

Metro Baton Rouge could see some occasional tropical storm force wind gusts during the day Tuesday and into Wednesday morning..

Along the coast winds will be highest with tropical storm force winds possible today..

Hurricane force winds remain possible along the extreme SE coast late Monday into early Tuesday as Sally’s core moves through..

We only expect very isolated power outages for the local area Tuesday into early Wednesday..

First Alert: Sally strengthens to Category 2 hurricane.

SOUTH MISSISSIPPI (WDAM) - Hurricane Sally continues to slow down as it approaches the northern Gulf Coast..

It is now much better organized than this morning and has strengthened to a stout Category 2 hurricane..

It is now forecast to be a Category 2 hurricane when it makes landfall somewhere along the Louisiana or Mississippi coastline..

What to expect:  The clouds will continue to race across the sky for t he next few days..

During the next 48 hours, conditions will deteriorate slowly as Sally gets closer to South Mississippi..

Rain bands will slowly move into the area with heavy rain and gusty wind..

While Sally is forecast to be a hurricane, the Pine Belt is not likely to experience hurricane conditions..

The worst of the weather will be relegated to the coast and within about 15 to 20 miles of the coast where landfall occurs..

Instead, the Pine Belt can expect tropical storm conditions; a lot of rain, some gusty wind and the potential for a few tropical tornadoes..

The amount of rain, wind and the threat for tornadoes will be highly dependent on the specific track, though..

That is still an unknown due to Sally’s slow forward speed and anticipated turn..

Because of all of this, we also expect power outages to occur, especially closer to the coast..

Timing:  The off-and-on rain and wind will continue through the overnight hours Monday night and through Tuesday and Wednesday as it appears right now..

Heavy rain and gusty wind are the two main concerns..

The threat for tornadoes will develop slowly, depending on the track of the system..

This may be a long-term, multi-day event for our area..

While it may not be raining non-stop, when rain bands do move through your area, they will bring with them heavy rain, gusty wind and the potential for a tropical tornado..

Threats:  Heavy rain, gusty wind and the chance for some tropical tornadoes will be the main concern..

Rainfall rates may be as high as two inches an hour within the rain bands..

Rain total estimates: 3 to 8 inches for most places with up up to 12 inches possible for a few spots..

Sustained wind estimates are at 20 mph to 50 mph with lighter winds in our northwest counties and stronger winds in our southeast counties..

The length of time to deal with sustained wind will be about 48 hours, or Monday night through Wednesday night..

The length of time with potential wind gusts will be 36 hours, or Tuesday morning to Wednesday night..

The estimates are based on the current forecast track and intensity..

Sally has lots of company during what has become one of the busiest hurricane seasons in history — so busy that forecasters have almost run through the alphabet of names with 2 1/2 months still to go..

For only the second time on record, forecasters said, five tropical cyclones were swirling simultaneously in the Atlantic basin..

In addition to Sally were Hurricane Paulette, which passed over a well-fortified Bermuda on Monday and was expected to peel harmlessly out into the North Atlantic; and Tropical Storms Rene, Teddy and .

As of late afternoon, Sally was about 145 miles (230 kilometers) southeast of Biloxi, Mississippi, moving at 6 mph (9 kph)..

The hurricane’s sluggish pace could give it more time to drench the Mississippi Delta with rain and storm surge..

The storm’s forecast track was nudged east Monday afternoon but much of southeast Louisiana remained under a hurricane warning..

Storm surge warnings stretched from Port Fourchon in Louisiana to the line between Okaloosa and Walton counties in Florida..

Also included: lakes Pontchartrain, Maurepas and Borgne in the New Orleans area and Mobile Bay in Alabama..

People in New Orleans watched the storm’s track intently, worried that Sally would pose the latest test for pumps used in the low-lying city’s century-old drainage system..

In eastern New Orleans, drainage canals were lowered in anticipation of torrential rains, Mayor LaToya Cantrell said..

New Orleans police went on 12-hour shifts, and rescue boats, barricades, backup generators and other equipment were readied, Police Superintendent Shaun Ferguson said..

In coastal Mississippi, water spilled onto roads, lawns and docks well before the storm’s arrival..

The town of Kiln, Mississippi, where many homes sit high on stilts along the Jourdan River and its tributaries, was under a mandatory evacuation order, and it appeared most residents obeyed..

Many of them moved their cars and boats to higher ground before clearing out..

Michael “Mac” Mclaughlin, a 72-year-old retiree who moved to Kiln a year ago, hooked his boat up to his pickup truck to take to his son’s house in another part of Mississippi before heading to New Orl.

He said his home was built in 2014 to withstand hurricanes, “but I just don’t want to be here when the water’s that deep and be stranded..

On Aug. 27, Hurricane Laura blow ashore in southwestern Louisiana along the Texas line, well west of New Orleans, tearing off roofs and leaving large parts of the city of Lake Charles uninhabitable..

The storm was blamed for 32 deaths in the two states, the vast majority of them in Louisiana..

More than 2,000 evacuees from Hurricane Laura remain sheltered in Louisiana, most of them in New Orleans-area hotels, Gov. John Bel Edwards said..

The extraordinarily busy hurricane season — like the catastrophic wildfire season on the West Coast — has focused attention on the role of climate change..

Scientists say global warming is making the strongest of hurricanes, those with wind speeds of 110 mph or more, even stronger..

Also, warmer air holds more moisture, making storms rainier, and rising seas from global warming make storm surges higher and more damaging..

In addition, scientists have been seeing tropical storms and hurricanes slow down once they hit the United States by about 17% since 1900, and that gives them the opportunity to unload more rain over .

In Mississippi, Reeves said Sally could dump up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain on the southern part of the state..

Shelters opened, but officials urged people who are evacuating to stay with friends or relatives or in hotels, if possible, because of the coronavirus..

People in shelters will be required to wear masks and other protective equipment, authorities said..

AccuWeather meteorologists are expecting the storm to reach Category 2 strength with winds of 96-110 mph..

There is a chance the hurricane could reach major hurricane strength with winds of at least 111 mph, prior to weakening before making landfall..

“While some additional strengthening of Sally is likely into early Tuesday, it is believed that the hurricane will weaken a bit prior to making landfall due to slow movement of the storm causing Gulf .

“We also expect wind shear to increase over the storm prior to making landfall, which would imply weakening of the intensity as well, but regardless this will still be a significant hurricane strike i.

Sally was churning 160 miles southeast of Biloxi, Mississippi, during Monday afternoon..

The hurricane was crawling slowly west-northwestward at 7 mph..

State of emergency declarations have been issued by Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards and Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves prior to Sally closing in on the region..

Mandatory evacuations have been ordered in low-lying areas of both states, including for areas outside of New Orleans levee system..

AccuWeather meteorologists expect Sally to take a northward turn that keeps the eye just east of the Mississippi Delta region of Louisiana with a landfall along the Mississippi or Alabama coast late T.

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves urged residents in the low-lying coastal region and south Mississippi to evacuate..

Officials warned Sally's arrival could coincide with high tide, bringing a significant storm surge with it..

"The storm surge projections continue to be worrisome," Reeves said in a Monday morning news conference..

"We are continuing to be very concerned about the amount of potential rainfall.".

First Hurricane Laura and then Sally  Late Monday morning, Tropical Storm Sally transformed into Hurricane Sally, its winds strengthening to Category 1 levels..

Louisiana and Mississippi were in the projected path of this rapidly intensifying and potentially dangerous storm..

The National Hurricane Center shifted Hurricane Sally's track slightly Monday, leaving southeast Louisiana in the cone of uncertainty but suggesting the storm's impact would be less if it keeps its ea.

The storm could make landfall Tuesday in southeast Louisiana at the southern tip of Plaquemines Parish, and then make a slow crawl through the day along the state's southeast coast before slamming int.

Sally damage:Expect heavy rain, winds and storm surge in southeast Louisiana  Louisiana residents still are recovering from the devastation left behind by another hurricane less than three weeks ago..

In late August, Hurricane Laura caused more than two dozen deaths and displaced tens of thousands from their homes..

The state is still providing shelter for about 13,000 evacuees..

More than 80,000 people in Lake Charles and southwestern Louisiana remain without power and 200,000-plus households do not have clean drinking water..

"We're going to continue to work on the recovery from Laura even as we prepare for Sally," Edwards said..

Hurricane forecasters predicted 2020 would bring a hyperactive storm season..

On Monday, Sally was one of five tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Basin, the National Weather Service said..

The threat of a slow-moving storm  One of the big worries with Sally is how slow the storm may move, which would cause a sustained period of wind and rain..

Edwards warned about the storm's crawl as did Reeves, who urged Mississippi residents to monitor the weather and be prepared for the worst case scenario, especially as the storm slows..

"It could get worse before it gets better," Reeves said..

In Gulfport, Miss., Chris Lane shoveled sand into bags at the Courthouse Pier on U.S. 90 along with other community members..

Lane was helping a couple of older people places sandbags around their houses and offered to grab some while he had a break..

Looking at the Mississippi Sound only a few yards away, Lane said water was his biggest concern as Sally crawled toward the coast..

"  Reports of minor flooding along the Mississippi coast started Monday..

Water also is a big concern in Louisiana even if Hurricane Sally does not make landfall in the state..

The National Weather Service has placed portions of extreme southeast Louisiana under high risk of excessive rainfall..

"If you see a road that's flooded and you're not absolutely 100% sure that it's safe, turn around, don't drown," Edwards said..

Sally's eastward shift on Sunday night eased worries for some residents in southeastern Louisiana, including Walter Sumner of Jean Lafitte..

But the 57-year-old shrimper and fisherman still expected Hurricane Sally to cause flooding in the area..

Going to be good shrimping after it passes," he said..

Thaddeus Bailey, 58, also of Jean Lafette, said he had lived in the area for nearly 35 years and had seen his share of flooded streets and power outages due to storms..

An hour ahead of the evacuation order he was still debating whether or not to leave..

If the electricity is out, we cook for each other..

COVID-19 outbreak further complicates hurricane prep  The ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 virus is further complicating hurricane preparations, including figuring out shelter logistics, Reeves said..

"Now is not the time let your guard down," Reeves said..

We are going to continue to work through it, but we want people to continue to wear your mask, we want people to continue to socially distance and we want people to continue to be aware not only weath.

"  Edwards also reminded residents Monday that COVID-19 is still a threat..

"Obviously the COVID public health emergency doesn't take time off in order for us to deal with the natural disasters that we've seen of late," Edwards said..

The state of Mississippi is borrowing from the recent lessons Louisiana learned after going through Laura, said Reeves, who spoke with Edwards on Monday..

The two states hope to collaborate their responses to Hurricane Sally..

NHC updates:Hurricane Sally likely to bring 'life-threatening' storm surge Monday night  "We worked very closely to help them during Hurricane Laura and with this storm ticking more and more to the ea.

Once Sally makes landfall, it is expected to weaken and become a tropical depression by Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said..

Hurricane Sally bears down on Gulf Coast as Category 2 with ‘life-threatening’ surge and excessive rain.

As Sally crawls along the coast of southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama for two to three days, it will unload tremendous amounts of rain and produce flooding, some of which is likely to be .

“Life-threatening flash flooding is possible and widespread minor to isolated major flooding on area rivers is likely along and just inland of the Central Gulf Coast,” the National Hurricane Center wr.

“Significant flash and urban flooding, as well as widespread minor to moderate river flooding is likely across Mississippi and Alabama through the middle of the week.”.

The center’s forecast calls for eight to 16 inches of rain with isolated amounts of 24 inches from southeast Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle close to the coast..

The Weather Service office in Mobile, Ala., warned of “possible devastating impacts” from the flooding..

It said rivers and tributaries may “overwhelmingly overflow their banks,” floodwaters could enter numerous structures, and that “numerous evacuations and rescues” may be necessary..

Hurricane #Sally is expected to bring heavy rain and life-threatening flash flooding over the next several days..

The current forecast is for 8-16" of rain, with isolated areas of 24"..

This amount of rain can bring a multitude of impacts..

The National Weather Service has placed portions of extreme southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, and coastal Alabama under a high risk of flash flooding between Tuesday morning and Wednesday mor.

Rainfall rates in excess of three inches per hour are possible..

By Wednesday, as the storm moves farther inland, six to 12 inches of rain are projected inland for southeastern Mississippi and Alabama..

Gaming commission orders Coast casinos to close ahead of Hurricane Sally.

BILOXI, Miss. (WLOX) - The Mississippi Gaming Commission has ordered all Coast casinos to close by 4 p.m. Monday ahead of Hurricane Sally..

The emergency order of closure states that the casinos will not be allowed to reopen until the directive is issued by Mississippi Gaming Commission commissioners..

Hurricane Sally’s threat: ‘Potentially historic’ floods, fierce winds.

WAVELAND, Miss. (AP) — Hurricane Sally, one of four storms churning simultaneously in the Atlantic, moved closer to the Gulf Coast on Monday with winds of 100 mph (161 kph) and heavy rain as forecaste.

Sally once appeared to have New Orleans in its sights and it was still moving toward the tip of southeast Louisiana late Monday..

But forecasters continued to nudge the track eastward throughout the day, and now expect the storm to blow ashore farther west, near the Mississippi-Alabama state line..

Sally was expected to produce between 8-16 inches (20-41 centimeters) of rain from the Florida Panhandle to southeastern Mississippi through mid-week, with 2 feet (.61 meters) of rain possible in isol.

There also was a possibility of tornadoes in the Panhandle and south Alabama late Monday and early Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center said in its public advisory..

“This is the real deal, and it deserves your attention,” Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves wrote on Twitter..

Hurricane warnings stretched from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to Navarre, Florida..

President Donald Trump tweeted late Monday that he was closely monitoring “extremely dangerous Hurricane Sally.”.

Trump urged residents to “be ready and listen to State and Local Leaders!”.

Earlier Monday, the president issued an emergency declaration for parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, an action that authorizes federal emergency officials to coordinate disaster relief effor.

BAY COUNTY, Fla. (WJHG/WECP) - High tide and storm surge make for a bad combination at Pirates Cove Marina..

“This is a significant amount," Pirates Cove Marina Director Jim Hamilton said..

Water flooded the docks early Monday morning and stuck around throughout the day..

It’s part of our prep that we did Saturday and Sunday," Hamilton said. ".

We’re just praying we don’t have a lot of dock damage.”.

He also said this is the worst flooding he has seen since Hurricane Michael, when these same docks sustained major damage back then..

“The best thing that could happen for us is just easy tide rising, not a lot of wave action..

A lot of slapping of the waves against the bottom of those dock boards will break them apart," Hamilton said..

The scene looks the same over in one Lynn Haven neighborhood..

Water also covered one homeowner’s dock earlier in the morning..

Usually, [a] normal high tide would be probably a foot below the dock," Ted Haney, a Lynn Haven resident, said..

Haney also said rain doesn’t typically cause them problems like this - it’s the storm surge that does..

“Of course, we’re on the wrong side of the storm, so it’s pushing the water into the bay, and it rises here; and the high tide coupled with that, and that’s what gave us the water in the yard," Haney .

Locals are still waiting to see what Tuesday brings..

“I think [Tuesday] is still going to be a pretty heavy rise in tide and rain," Hamilton said..

MERIDIAN, Miss. (WTOK) - UPDATE: As of the 7 a.m. update from the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Tropical Storm Sally has sustained winds of 65 mph..

The next forecast track from the NHC will be issued around 10 a.m. today..

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION BELOW:  OVERVIEW: As of the 4 a.m. update from the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Tropical Storm Sally has sustained winds of 60 mph..

The storm is forecast to strengthen to a hurricane later today as it slowly approaches the Gulf of Mexico..

The latest official track from the NHC has shifted a bit to the east..

This means the center of Sally may not cross over Louisiana, but instead it could make a first landfall along the Mississippi Gulf Coast Tuesday night..

Sustained winds at landfall are forecast to be around 85-90 mph..

The storm will quickly weaken once on land and move into Alabama Wednesday night as a tropical depression..

LOCAL IMPACTS: We’ll see scattered showers and storms on Monday, mainly south of I-20..

Rain and storm chances will pick up from south to north throughout the day on Tuesday..

Heavy rainfall will overspread our area by Tuesday night and into Wednesday..

Rainfall will begin to diminish late Wednesday night and into Thursday morning..

We could see up to 4-8 inches of rainfall during this time frame..

Some spots, especially north of I-20, could see lower amounts..

This will lead to flash flooding in places and this threat will be our greatest concern going forward..

Sally will weaken into a tropical depression by the time the center gets to our area on Wednesday..

Winds will be sustained between 25 and 35 mph, but winds could still gust as high as 50 mph..

An isolated brief and weak tornado or two cannot be ruled out mainly Tuesday night and Wednesday..

However, heavy rainfall will limit the instability over our area and thus limit the tornado threat overall..

UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECAST: Sally is a slow-moving storm..

These slow movers are always a pain to forecast, and Tropical Storm Sally will be no different..

Questions remain on just how strong Sally will get before making landfall..

I’m not expecting it to reach Hurricane Laura strength, but it could be a stronger storm at landfall than what the NHC is forecasting..

There is also a chance Sally only stays a tropical storm throughout its journey across the Gulf..

The track of Sally has shifted eastward compared to the past couple of days..

A Mississippi landfall now looks likely, but there is still time for a track shift either west or east..

If Sally goes eastward enough, our area could potentially be on the calmer side of the storm and our local impacts will be lower..

The bottom line is that this forecast is still subject to change as a lot of uncertainty remains..

So please keep up to date with the latest forecast!.

REST OF THE WEEK: Rain chances will decrease from south to north on Thursday as Sally pulls away from our area..

We’ll see mostly cloudy skies on Friday with highs in the mid-80s and a chance of a stray shower..

We’ll see lots of sunshine both Saturday and Sunday..

Morning lows will drop into the low-60s both mornings; however, some spots may even drop into the 50s!.

Highs on Saturday and Sunday will be in the upper-70s to low-80s..

Pensacola declares state of emergency ahead of Hurricane Sally.

Pensacola Mayor Grover Robinson declared a state of emergency as Hurricane Sally approached the Gulf Coast and was expected to bring up to 20 inches of rain to the area..

Robinson said Monday morning during a press conference that he would be issuing a state of emergency as the storm approached, and city workers prepared to brace the city for the impact of the storm..

"We could have significant rainfall," Robinson said..

"I don't have to remind you of April 2014 when we had over 20 inches of rain.".

In April 2014, the Pensacola area received more than 24 inches of rain in 24 hours, and Sally threatens to dump a large amount of rainfall over a short period of one to two days, pushing the areas sto.

City crews spent the weekend preparing stormwater drains and ponds to ensure they were ready for the storm, Robinson said..

"We do expect to have significantly better drainage coverage than we did in 2014," Robinson said..

"And even in 2014, we had drainage coverage that rivals most communities..

I mean, most communities aren't prepared to deal with 10 to 11 inches of storm, but we've been able to accomplish that..

Obviously, as we start moving to 18 to 24 inches, that's where we start having some concern..

"  As of 10 a.m., the official forecast from the National Hurricane Center was calling for 10 to 15 inches of rain for most of Escambia County, while in extreme southern portions of the county, 15 to .

Pensacola is already under one state of emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic..

Robinson said he plans to meet with hospital officials Monday afternoon to discuss the current state of the virus in the community..

Robinson has previously said he would want to repeal the city's mask mandate when daily hospitalizations were below 75 people..

However, Robinson said the city is focused on preparing and responding to Hurricane Sally and more information about the city's response to COVID-19 will come after the storm..

During high tide Monday morning, the city was already experiencing tidal flooding because of the rising water levels..

Seawater pushed up through storm drains near Admiral Mason Park on Ninth Avenue during the 8 a.m. high tide, Robinson said..

The city will likely close roads in areas that experience tidal flood during storms such as DeVillers and Main Street and 17th Avenue near Graffiti Bridge..

"Our police officers, while they're out patrolling, will be going by areas we know to historically have flooding problems, and they're going to be updating public works if they need to get out there a.

"Obviously, if we get to a point where the wind gets high enough, we can't get out there..

We'll have to get out there as soon as it dies down..

Hurricane Sally strengthens into a Category 2 storm as it inches towards landfall: NHC updates.

Hurricane Sally has re-strengthened back into a Category 2 hurricane as the storm approaches landfall, according to the latest update from the NHC..

Sally's maximum sustained winds have strengthened to 100 mph with a sustained wind of 76 mph and a gust of 96 mph was recently reported in the northern eyewall of Sally, which is located 50 miles sout.

An unofficial report of 60 mph wind gusts was recently received from an amateur radio operator in Navarre Beach, Florida, according to the NHC..

Hurricane Sally is currently located 60 miles southwest of Pensacola..

On the forecast track, Sally's center is expected to reach the northern Gulf coast later Wednesday morning..

The eye became a little better defined by 10 p.m. Tuesday and the barometric pressure had dropped again..

The hurricane center said Sally could strengthen before landfall, expected around 7 a.m.  Significant flash flooding possible  Sally is expected to bring 10 to 20 inches of rainfall with isolated amou.

Further inland, the NHC predicts 6 to 10 inches of rain, with locally higher amounts of 10-20 inches..

Dauphin Island and Alabama to the Alabama-Florida border, including Mobile Bay is expected to see 4-6 feet of storm surge..

A slow north-northeastward to northeastward motion is expected tonight and through Wednesday night..

Hurricane warnings in effect:  East of Bay St. Louis, Miss, to Navarre, Fla..

Storm surge warning in effect:  Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Okaloosa/Walton County Line, and for Mobile Bay..

Sally now a Category 2 Hurricane; Will Bring Significant Impacts to North-Central Gulf Coast.

Sally rapidly intensified into a hurricane this morning, and has since become a category 2 hurricane..

As of the 4 PM CDT advisory maximum sustained winds were 100 mph, the central pressure was 987 mb, and movement was west-northwest at 6 mph..

Forecast for Sally  Given the episode of rapid intensification, it is now probable Sally will become a strong category 2, or perhaps even a category 3, before landfall..

This is a significant change since this morning’s update, when rapid intensification was looking less likely..

Additionally, model guidance has shifted east throughout the day..

It now appears the center of Sally will come ashore somewhere along the Mississippi or Alabama Gulf Coast late tomorrow or early Wednesday..

However, there is still some uncertainty, and a southeast Louisiana landfall is still within the realm of possibilities..

Impacts  Due to the eastward shift in track, a greater wind and surge impact is now possible for portions of southwest Alabama and the the western Florida Panhandle..

Aside from this, there have been no changes with regard to impacts..

A storm surge of up to 11′ is still forecast for portions of southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi..

Hurricane-force winds (> 74 mph) remain likely in southeast Louisiana, south Mississippi, and southwest Alabama..

In addition, hurricane-force winds are now possible for portions of the western Florida Panhandle (within the Hurricane Warning area, see watch/warning summary below)..

Tropical-storm-force winds (> 39 mph) also remain likely along the Florida Panhandle..

Furthermore, anywhere from 6 to 20″ of rain is still likely across southeast Louisiana, south Mississippi, southwest Alabama, and the western Florida Panhandle..

It is also still expected the decrease in forward speed will exacerbate the issue of storm surge and flash flooding..

Lastly, a threat for waterspouts/tornadoes continues to exist as outer bands/squalls come onshore..

Warning/Watch Summary  A Storm Surge Warning is in effect for…  * Port Fourchon Louisiana to the Okaloosa/Walton County Line Florida  * Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and Lake Borgne  * Mobile Bay.

Shelters open in Mississippi ahead of Hurricane Sally.

Several storm shelters opened Monday as Hurricane Sally neared the Coast and prompted mandatory evacuations..

Here's what Mississippi schools are closed ahead of Hurricane Sally  Such storm shelters do not allow alcohol, drugs or weapons inside..

Open shelters are in:  Forrest County  Hattiesburg officials said Tuesday morning they were still deciding whether to open a shelter, and would announce a decision later in the day..

George County  Benndale Storm Shelter, 5207 Highway 26 West, Lucedale  Agricola Storm Shelter, 3161 Cooks Corner Road, Lucedale  Hancock County  Kiln Community Center, 18320 Highway 43, Kiln  Harrison.

It is a "shelter of last resort" for people whose medical needs can't be accommodated in other shelters, such as those who require special observation, supervised help with medication, and those with .

One caregiver may accompany the resident inside the shelter..

Hurricane Sally: Alabama issues state of emergency as 'historic flooding,' tornadoes expected from Gulf storm.

Gov. Kay Ivey has issued a state of emergency and closed Alabama's beaches as Hurricane Sally slowly made its way to the Gulf Coast on Monday..

The storm has the potential to bring "dangerous and potentially historic flooding" for the Gulf Coast as well as heavy rainfall and possible tornadoes in central Alabama..

The National Hurricane Center said as of 1 p.m. Monday, the slow-moving storm was about 160 mile south east of Biloxi, Mississippi, moving about 7 mph..

It's expected to make landfall tonight or early Tuesday..

Previously a tropical storm, Sally was upgraded to a hurricane shortly after 11 a.m. Monday..

Gov. Kay Ivey on Monday issued a state of emergency ahead of the storm..

Earlier today, I issued a State of Emergency because those on the Gulf Coast know a flood and heavy rains can be just as deadly as tropical winds," Ivey was quoted as saying.  ".

As your governor, you have my assurance that every resource will be available if we need it..

Hours later, Ivey ordered all Alabama beaches be closed by 3 p.m. and recommended the evacuation of non-residents and those who live south of Interstate 10..

"Alabamians are no stranger to tropical weather and the significant damage these storms can do, even though our state is not currently in the direct line of impact," she said..

"Locals will need to prepare their homes, businesses and personal property for immenent storm surge, heavy rain and flash flooding..

I urge everyone to tune in to their trusted weather source, and pay attention to your local officials for updates regarding your area as they make further recommendations based off the unique needs of.

"  The timing of the storm's impact on the rest of Alabama is still uncertain, National Weather Service Meteorologist Daniel Martin said.  ".

It will move through central Alabama probably Wednesday and Thursday," he said. ".

It's possible it'll linger into late Thursday then move into Georgia early Friday morning as a depression..

"  While Alabama is not expected to take a direct hit from the storm, its force will be felt in the coastal portions of the state..

The Gulf coast is currently under a hurricane, tropical storm and a storm surge warning with a possibility of 4 to 6 feet..

With a storm surge comes a "danger of life-threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, during the next 36 hours," according to the National Hurricane Center..

Promptly follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials," according to the center..

Southwest counties such as Mobile, Baldwin and Washington could see between 10 and 15 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service..

If the storm slows down once it makes landfall, as it is expected to do, it could bring up to a foot of rain in portions of central Alabama which is under a flash flood watch, Martin said..

The watch sweeps from the western Sumter and Choctaw counties to Calhoun and Cleburne counties in east Alabama slowly dropping less rain as it goes..

"We could see winds gusting up to 30 mph, but this will be a rain event for us," he said..

"Flash flooding is the primary concern and river flooding is a concern too.".

Nick Lolley, Tuscaloosa County Emergency Management Agency director, said he has meetings scheduled with the Red Cross and representatives of the city of Tuscaloosa, the city of Northport and Tuscaloo.

“This will be really big for our public works in the county because we are expecting 4 to 6 inches of rain,” Lolley said Monday..

Localized flooding and downed trees are expected, with the possibility of some tornadoes, he said..

This is something that Tuscaloosa County citizens are used to..

(If) you know you live in a low-lying area, use caution and prepare now..

Do not wait until Wednesday morning when it’s raining hard to make your plans,” Lolley said..

Tuscaloosa Fire and Rescue’s swift water team has been on alert, he said..

The River Region likely won't see an impact from Sally until Tuesday night at the earliest, meteorologist Rich Thomas of the Rich Thomas Weather Network said..

"We're going to be on the east side of Sally's track which is the worst side, the most active side," Thomas said..

"After it makes landfall it's going to slow down tremendously and curve into Alabama.".

Thomas said the Montgomery area will likely see between 3 and 6 inches of rain..

In the western counties where the storm will first pass through, they'll likely see between 6 and 9 inches, Thomas said..

"It's going to be a ridiculous amount of rain," he said..

Along with the rain and a possible flooding, a few tornadoes are also likely..

"These tropical spin up tornadoes are very quick to spin up, are only on the ground for a minute or two, but can do a lot of damage," Thomas said..

"While most of these storms are in and out, this one will be poking along so it's going to have a prolonged effect.".

Thomas said everyone should have a reliable weather app on their phone that can alert to possible dangers..

"People also might want to go through their yard and pick up objects that could becomes projectiles, like patio furniture..

"  For the Etowah County area, the forecast is wet, but that's the worst that is expected at this point..

Gadsden/Etowah County Emergency Management Duty Officer Jerry Ramsey said the National Weather Service's Monday briefing forecast 4 to six inches of rain for the area on Wednesday and Thursday..

WIth that level of rain, he said, flash flooding can't be ruled out, even though Etowah County is not included at present in watches or warning for it..

As Hurricane Sally Looms, the Gulf Coast Braces Itself Yet Again.

Sally will strike eastern Louisiana as the state is still clawing its way back from the devastation from Laura, which was one of the most powerful hurricanes to pummel the state when it made landfall .

The storm surge inundated a stretch of the state’s western coast, and its winds shredded many communities, particularly in and around Lake Charles, a city of roughly 78,000 people near the Texas borde.

Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana told residents on Monday that Sally would not distract from the work of cleaning up after Laura and restoring electricity and other utilities to the thousands who re.

Still, the aftermath of Laura complicated preparations for the looming storm, as many who had fled their destroyed homes or untenable living conditions have now found themselves squarely in Sally’s pr.

Sally, the 18th named storm of the season, is approaching the Gulf Coast during what has already been a punishing year..

The region has been affected by the coronavirus, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods and a summer of demonstrations against police brutality and racism..

And it comes as climate change is making hurricanes more dangerous in many ways, including increased rainfall and more powerful storm surge..

Alabama beaches closed, coastal evacuation recommended.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - Gov. Kay Ivey has ordered the closure of Alabama’s beaches ahead of Hurricane Sally’s landfall..

The governor is also recommending people evacuate, especially those who are non-residents, and those living in flood-prone areas south of I-10..

The closure follows a state of emergency declaration that became effective as of 6 a.m. Monday..

“As the recently upgraded Hurricane Sally continues heading closer to the Gulf Coast, we must give individuals time to prepare for the anticipated impacts of this storm," Ivey said..

Life-threatening flash flooding is likely, as well as widespread minor to isolated major flooding, on area rivers along and just inland of the Central Gulf Coast..

Significant flash and urban flooding, as well as widespread minor to moderate river flooding, is likely across Mississippi and Alabama through the middle of the week..

Flooding impacts are expected to spread farther across the Southeast through the week..

Sally could continue to produce flash flooding across the Florida peninsula and prolong existing minor river flooding across west-central Florida through today..

Storm surge is already causing flooding along the shores of Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana, AccuWeather reports..

"Some areas could remain underwater for an extended period of time as storm surge continues and heavy, flooding rainfall moves inland.".

Sally is expected to be a slow-moving system as it approaches land, producing 200 – 400 mm (8 to 16 inches) of rainfall with isolated amounts of 600 mm (24 inches) over portions of the central Gulf Co.

"Life-threatening flash flooding is likely," NHC warns..

"In addition, this rainfall will likely lead to widespread minor to isolated major flooding on area rivers.".

Some coastal areas in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida and Alabama are already seeing floods from the slow-moving storm, with Sally meandering over the north-central Gulf of Mexico..

Its forward speed will slow even further as it heads northwest and finally north toward landfall..

The surge could be as high as 11 feet in some areas..

The storm will also bring a huge amount of rain — from 8 to 16 inches, with up to 24 inches in isolated areas of the central Gulf Coast and the western Florida Panhandle..

"Slow movement means more rain," National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham said in an online briefing..

As of Monday night, Sally was about 100 miles east of the mouth of the Mississippi RiverBiloxi, creeping west-northwest at 5 mph..

Its maximum sustained winds were measured at 100 mph..

It would need to develop winds of at least 111 mph to become a Category 3 storm — a major hurricane..

"Impacts of an extremely dangerous and life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds and torrential rain with flash flooding from Sally will likely begin later today," the National Weather Servi.

"Additional strengthening is forecast during the next day or so," the center said..

Forecasters said conditions are too unstable to predict exactly where the storm will arrive..

Current projections show Sally coming ashore east of Gulfport, Miss..

The predicted track has shifted consistently eastward in the past 24 hours, bringing a measure of relief to people in southwestern Louisiana, which is still recovering from Hurricane Laura in late Aug.

Sally's effects are already being felt in Florida, where it was expected to create flash floods across the peninsula Monday, the hurricane center said..

The storm is adding to major flooding already happening across western and central Florida, the agency said..

Sally is one of five named storms the agency is tracking – tying a record from September 1971 for the most tropical cyclones at one time, according to senior hurricane specialist Eric Blake of the hur.

The newest is Tropical Storm Vicky, which developed late Monday morning..

Hurricane Paulette made landfall on Bermuda early Monday, bringing sustained winds of at least 90 mph with higher gusts, the hurricane center said..

At around 5 a.m. local time, the entire island was inside the storm's eyewall..

The storm's center is now moving north-northwest away from the island, but dangers persist from strong winds and heavy rain that are still to come..

"Please stay hunkered down Bermuda," the Bermuda Weather Service said Monday morning..

People in Bermuda should remain indoors until at least Monday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said, warning that "winds will increase suddenly from the southwest.".

The massive amount of water Sally brings will pose a perilous threat from its storm surge and heavy rainfall..

Heightening that risk, the storm is expected to continue to move slowly, increasing the impact of its rainfall..

"Life-threatening flash flooding is possible and widespread minor to isolated major flooding on area rivers is likely along and just inland of the Central Gulf Coast," the National Hurricane Center sa.

A storm surge warning is in effect from Port Fourchon, La., to the Alabama-Florida border, including several lakes and Mobile Bay..

A hurricane warning is in effect from Morgan City, La., (west of New Orleans) to the Mississippi-Alabama border..

Parts of Mississippi and Alabama will also see the risk of significant flash and urban flooding through the middle of the week, the National Hurricane Center said..

"Life threatening surf and rip currents have begun along our beaches this morning," said the National Weather Service office in Mobile, Ala. "Waves will continue to increase throughout the day and DOU.

"  "The window of time you have left to get ready is quickly closing," Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards told residents Sunday night..

Edwards declared a state of emergency over the weekend; he has also asked President Trump to declare a federal emergency..

"The storm is expected to impact New Orleans, where the state is currently housing more than 12,000 Hurricane Laura evacuees in hotels," NPR member station WWNO reported..

Overall, the hurricane center is tracking seven systems — the five named storms and two disturbances that have only small chances of developing over the next 48 hours..

At this early stage, Teddy is expected to follow a similar path to Paulette's, although with a sharper turn to the north..

The other named storm is Tropical Storm Vicky – which formed Monday but is expected to devolve quickly..

Rene is experiencing a similar fate; it was declared a tropical depression over the Atlantic on Monday..

OFFICIAL: Sally makes landfall as a Category 2 hurricane.

ROANOKE, Va. – 6 a.m. Wednesday Update  Sally made landfall around 5:45 a.m. ET as a Category 2 hurricane near Gulf Shores, Alabama..

Some of the strongest wind gusts have been around Fort Morgan, AL at 118 mph..

Radar-estimated rain totals northeast of the eye have been between 1-2 feet..

For how the storm will impact us at home, click this link ..

2 a.m. Wednesday Update  Sally is moving at 2 mph, and the eye wall is approaching the Mobile Bay..

Life-threatening flooding is ongoing, as some places have seen 12-18″ of rain..

Extreme wind around the eye wall of the storm will impact the Gulf Coast of Alabama and parts of the Florida Panhandle..

5 a.m. Tuesday Update  Sally is moving at a snail’s pace..

Regardless of the fact the storm has “weakened” to a Category 1 hurricane, it will still bring a tremendous amount of rain to parts of the Gulf Coast..

For us, we’re looking at 1″ or more of rain late Thursday and Friday in areas south of US 460..

Ad  2 a.m. Tuesday Update  Sally is moving at only 3 mph, which means that landfall will be delayed until Wednesday near the Mississippi-Alabama coastline..

As of 2 a.m. Tuesday, it is a Category 1 hurricane..

12 p.m. Monday Update  Data from Hurricane Hunters has found that Sally is a Category 1 hurricane over very warm Gulf waters..

It is forecast to make landfall Tuesday on the Louisiana-Mississippi border..

11 a.m. Monday Update  Tropical Depression 21 off the west coast of Africa has strengthened into Tropical Storm Vicky, leaving us with only one name left on the Atlantic hurricane season..

This is the earliest 'V' storm on record by nearly a month..

#Vicky has formed in far eastern tropical Atlantic - the 20th named storm of the 2020 Atlantic #hurricane season to date..

Sally formed over the weekend and is slowly strengthening over warm Gulf waters..

It’s slowly strengthening but also slowly moving toward the Mississippi - Alabama coast..

Ad  Nothing is around to pull Sally north, so the storm will meander around the Gulf Coast for a few days..

This is bad news for parts of southern Mississippi and southern Alabama, where tropical rain will lead to a significant flood threat..

Tracking Sally and how much rain will produce in the Deep South  Eventually, a cold front picks the storm up and shifts it farther to the east..

At this point, Sally will be much weaker and turn into a remnant low pressure system..

Where it goes from there will be crucial to our forecast late Thursday and Friday..

If the cold front picks it up farther south, then we will see less rain during that time frame..

If the cold front picks it up farther north, then we’ll see more rain..

At the moment, there’s the chance we see 1-2″+ of rain south of U.S. 460..

Tracking Sally and how much rain will produce in the Mid-Atlantic  We’ll keep you posted to any changes in the storm’s path and its potential impact here..

Latest:Hurricane Sally to bring 'historically significant' rainfall, flooding to Pensacola  The National Hurricane Center extended the hurricane warning from Louisiana to Navarre on Monday evening..

Escambia County has not announced any shelter openings yet..

Residents of Sanibel are dealing with severe flooding from what is now Hurricane Sally..

Sally moved westward over Collier County on Sunday as a tropical storm before entering the Gulf and strengthening..

On the island, they’ve had more than 20 inches of rain in the past nine days and streets and yards are currently underwater, leaving some worried about their homes..

Some parts of the island saw upwards of 8 inches in a short period..

The standing water on a section of Southwinds Drive is shin-high in the street and up to the doors of some homes..

Other parts of Sanibel are still feeling the impacts of Sally after rain pounded the island all weekend long..

Tom Schmidt described it as “noisy like we had a small hurricane,” saying his yard was looking more like a pond..

He was here for Hurricane Irma and said the flooding from Sally doesn’t compare, “This was much worse..

We have things in our downstairs and I thought wow, it might actually get in there and breach it.”.

He went to check on neighbors’ homes who weren’t so fortunate..

Mayor Kevin Ruane agrees that a rain band from Sally hit them harder than they expected..

When you get that amount of rain, 7, 8, 9 inches, there’s nowhere for it to go.”.

All that’s left to do is wait for the floodwaters to go down..

The mayor said he’s looking into finding money to help people with clean up and damage repairs..

Right now, he hopes everyone is patient and careful as the waters recede..

Bonita Springs  Sanibel isn’t the only place that is seeing flooding..

Some in Bonita Springs said the rain from the tropical storm brought back memories of Hurricane Irma three years ago..

Felicia Wilkinson said it “kind of reminded me of the last hurricane that we went through, Irma, when everything was underwater, it rained so fast here.”.

Bonita Springs residents want the city to do more for drainage to help with future storms..

After Sally’s rains, checking the mailbox requires wading through water..

Dwight Esmon said their yard usually stays dry, but when it’s underwater, they call it “Lake Morningside.”.

And it’s not “Lake Morningside’s” first appearance for the 13-year residents..

Esmon said, “Anytime we have a large amount of rain for a short period of time, once the ground is saturated and the street gets covered in water and the ditches fill up and it doesn’t flow anywhere.”.

Down Paradise Road, you can see yards filled with water, sidewalks overflowing and roads blocked..

Felicia Wilkinson said the City of Bonita Springs needs to do more than just put in swales, “They put a swale out and it’s great but the water sits there, mosquitoes sit there, snakes sit there.”.

Esmon hopes for a city project to possibly use a former golf course to improve stormwater drainage will help..

“I’m hoping the city is going to do what needs to be done in order to take care of the problem,” he added..

The City of Bonita Springs said a study showed its golf course flood improvement project could help improve both water quality and stormwater drainage..

COLLIER COUNTY  The rain for Sally in Collier County caused a mess for Matthew Philpot at his plant nursery, Clark’s Plant Service, in East Naples..

“It was like a bad dream, it brought back Irma,” he said..

Water flooded their pond and overflowed into their plant houses..

“Irma, we probably lost around $100,000 worth of inventory..

It’s a scary situation”  Thankfully, it was not enough to hurt his business..

Some in Collier County also woke up to flooded neighborhoods..

Jerry Wright lives on Pelican Street on Marco Island and said that on Sunday, it was underwater..

“It didn’t seem to stop people; they just seem to go right on through.”.

Crews are working throughout Collier County to drain standing water from ditches..

“The county in the last month has come through and retrenched the ditches, and that has helped,” Philpot said..

Sally Stronger; Expected to Become a Hurricane Tonight.

As of the 7 AM CDT advisory, maximum sustained winds were up to 65 mph, the minimum central pressure was down to 994 mb, and movement west-northwest at 8 mph..

Forecast for Sally  Sally is expected to become a hurricane before landfall..

However, given that Sally hasn’t strengthened any overnight, some of the more extreme solutions (i.e. a strong category 2 or category 3 hurricane) are unlikely to come to fruition..

The National Hurricane Center is forecasting a 85 mph category 1 at landfall, but it is still possible Sally could become a low-end category 2..

There is uncertainty with the short-term forecast track for Sally..

Sally is going to slow down tonight and tomorrow, and could even stall, as the ridge of high pressure steering it begins to erode/back to the east..

A trough will then turn the system north/northeast..

Where exactly Sally turns will dictate where Sally makes landfall..

Currently, landfall is expected tomorrow, but could be anywhere from Grand Isle, LA to Mobile, AL..

Impacts  Storm surge, heavy rain, and flash flooding are shaping up to be the main impacts from Sally..

A storm surge of 3 – 11′ is forecast for portions of southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi..

Hurricane-force winds (> 74 mph) will also be likely in southeast Louisiana and south Mississippi with hurricane-force gusts possible as far east as coastal Alabama..

Anywhere from 6 to 20″ of rain will be likely in southeast Louisiana, south Mississippi, southwest Alabama, and the western Florida Panhandle..

The decrease in forward speed will exacerbate the issue of storm surge and flash flooding..

In addition, there will be a risk for tornadoes/waterspouts..

Warning/Watch Summary  A Storm Surge Warning is in effect for…  * Port Fourchon Louisiana to the Alabama/Florida Border  * Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and Lake Borgne  * Mobile Bay  A Hurricane.

LIVE updates: Hurricane Sally closes in on Gulf Coast with ‘potentially historic’ floods, fierce winds.

UPDATE: Hurricane Sally is slowly closing in on the northern Gulf Coast with powerful winds and weather forecasters are warning of “potentially historic” flooding..

Hurricane warnings stretch from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Navarre, Florida..

The storm reached Category 2 strength with sustained winds of 100 mph Monday afternoon..

Sally is threatening to make landfall Tuesday as a Category 2 storm..

Data from a hurricane hunter aircraft shows the wind speeds strengthening, and the storm could hit the coast with 105 mph winds, just a few miles per hour shy of a Category 3 designation, the National.

The latest update, released by the National Hurricane Center, showed the storm about 160 miles southeast of Biloxi, Mississippi, as of Monday afternoon..

The storm presently has 90 mph winds, but of more concern is its sluggish final approach, forecasters say..

"Since Sally is forecast to be moving very slowly around the time of landfall, a slower rate of weakening is indicated since a large portion of the circulation will remain over water for some time," t.

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves signed a preliminary state of emergency Sunday..

Mississippi officials are working to make decisions on possible mandatory evacuations, he said..

During a Monday briefing, the governor said he feared his state would bear the brunt of Sally's rain and storm surge, and he urged residents to prepare for prolonged power outages..

"We're lucky enough to live in the center of the island, so it's not hopefully gonna be too bad for us," Ryan Gieselman told the station..

"I hope it really just misses us and we can go on with the rest of our summer and enjoy it, but if it hits us, just be prepared and be ready to hunker down.".

Gov. Kay Ivey issued a state of emergency for Alabama and closed all beaches as of 3 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) Monday..

"Bad weather is nothing to take lightly," she said in a statement..

"You have my assurance that every resource will be available if we need it..

"  Coastal areas between eastern Louisiana and western Florida could see anywhere between 1 and 8 feet of storm surge, though the coast between the Mississippi River and Ocean Springs, Mississippi, ea.

In Gulfport, Mississippi, hardware and grocery stories are stocked, but at least one store manager said he isn't seeing the normal crush of customers stocking up on plywood and other wares, according .

"I think a lot of the folks were still stocked up when Marco and Laura come up because it was a near miss, but a lot of folks got prepared for that," said Bill Collins, who manages a hardware store in.

"I'm doing what everybody else that has any sense would do," Ward told the station..

"I'm being prepared for the worst and hoping it will be as it has been earlier this year..

"  Louisiana not taking chances  Though Louisiana is no longer expected to face a direct hit, "an extremely dangerous and life-threatening storm surge is expected" in the southeast portion of the stat.

Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency, and mandatory evacuations have been issued for part or all of several parishes, and for New Orleans residents who live outside the levee protection.

Venetian Isles, Lake Catherine and Irish Bayou, which are not protected by substantial levees, could see storm surge of up to 11 feet, NOLA Ready, the city's emergency preparedness network, said in a .

New Orleans' 99 drainage pumps, critical to staving off street flooding, are fully operational, according to the city's Sewerage and Water Board, which activated its emergency operations center early .

"You should be gathering your emergency supplies, three days' worth," Collin Arnold, director of the New Orleans Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, warned..

Officials "have every reason to believe that this storm represents a very significant threat to the people of Southeast Louisiana," Edwards said, adding he has spoken to President Donald Trump and is .

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved assistance for 21 parishes impacted by Laura, according to a news release issued by the governor's office..

Sally comes less than three weeks after Hurricane Laura made landfall as a Category 4, causing widespread flooding and damage in southwest Louisiana and leaving six people dead..

At Laura's peak, more than 800,000 customers lost electricity..

Sally was one of five tropical cyclones in the Atlantic on Monday -- a phenomenon that's happened only once before, almost 50 years ago..

This slow moving storm is now a category 2, with winds in excess of 100 mph..

These winds are sufficient to cause damage, but biggest threat will remain flooding and storm surge..

Rain totals near the eye on the east side are averaging just over a foot, and surge estimates for South MS range between 6-9 feet..

If you live on the coast, assess your situation, and enact your hurricane plan..

Evacuations have been ordered in Hancock County “for all low lying areas, residents living on rivers, river inlets, bayous, creeks, and in travel trailers.”.

Flash Flood Watches will remain in effect until at least 7 AM Thursday, showing just how long this heavy rain event is expected to last..

Continue to prepare, but time is running out for any significant preparations as Tropical storm force winds will begin arriving tonight and only increase through all of Tuesday..

Hurricane Sally: Alabama beaches closed, possible tornadoes, NHC updates for Monday.

Gov. Kay Ivey has issued a state of an emergency closing Alabama's beaches as Hurricane Sally slowly makes its way to the Gulf Shores on Monday..

Alabama's Dauphin Island is already flooding as Hurricane Sally approaches landfall, according to the Weather Channel..

As of 10 p.m. CT, Hurricane Sally remained a Category 2 storm and was located by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 28.9 North latitud.

A decrease in forward speed and a turn toward the northwest is forecast tonight and a northward turn is expected sometime on Tuesday..

On the forecast track, the center of Sally is forecast to move over the north-central Gulf of Mexico Monday, approach southeastern Louisiana Monday night, and make landfall in the hurricane warning ar.

Afterward, Sally is expected to move slowly north-northeastward near the northern Gulf Coast through Wednesday..

Maximum sustained winds are measured at 100 mph with higher gusts, making Sally a Category 2 hurricane..

Additional strengthening is forecast during the next day or so, and Sally is expected to be a dangerous hurricane when it moves onshore along the north-central Gulf Coast..

SOUTH MISSISSIPPI (WLOX) - Hurricane Sally will produce devastating to catastrophic rainfall as well as dangerous storm surge..

So, a significant river flooding threat will be in place..

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – The most interesting turn in the slow-moving saga called Sally, is a notable shift in the forecast tracks to the east..

As of 5 a.m. Wednesday, the center of Hurricane Sally was impacting Gulf Shores, Ala...

A slow northward motion is expected tonight, followed by a slow north-northeastward to northeastward motion Wednesday night..

A slightly faster northeastward motion is expected on Thursday..

On the forecast track, the center of Sally will approach the northern Gulf Coast tonight, and make landfall in the hurricane warning area late tonight or Wednesday..

Sally is expected to move inland across southeastern Alabama Wednesday night and Thursday..

TRACKING THE TROPICS: Interactive map  Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft and NWS Doppler radar indicates that maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph with higher gusts..

Little change in strength is forecast until landfall occurs and Sally is expected to be a dangerous hurricane when it moves onshore along the north-central Gulf Coast..

Ad  Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles..

A NOAA buoy located about 50 miles southeast of Mobile, Alabama, recently reported sustained winds of 58 mph and a gust to 67 mph within the past couple of hours..

An observing site at the Okaloosa Fishing Pier in Florida has reported sustained winds of 44 mph and a gust to 52 mph..

Ad  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline..

The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide..

Mouth of the Mississippi River to Ocean Springs, MS including Lake Borgne...6-9 ft  Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL Border...4-6 ft  MS/AL Border to AL/FL Border including Mobile Bay...2-4 ft  Lake Pontcha.

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and damaging waves..

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle and can vary greatly over short distances..

In addition to storm surge, Sally is expected to produce heavy rainfall after landfall..

Sally is expected to be a slow-moving system as it approaches land, producing 8 to 16 inches of rainfall with isolated amounts of 24 inches over portions of the central Gulf Coast from the western Flo.

Ad  In addition, this rainfall will likely lead to widespread minor to isolated major flooding on area rivers..

Sally is forecast move farther inland early Wednesday and tracks into the Southeast with rainfall of 6 to 12 inches possible across portions of inland southeast Mississippi and Alabama..

Further heavy rain is then anticipated across portions of eastern Tennessee, northern Georgia and western Carolinas Thursday into Friday..

Visitors to St. George Island waiting out effects from Sally.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) - Double-red flags are back out at beaches around Franklin County as Hurricane Sally continues to move closer to the area, bringing with it big waves and flood warnings..

Earlier Monday afternoon, Franklin County Schools announced that all schools across the district will be closed on Tuesday..

It’s not exactly the kind of weather you hope for when coming to the island for vacation; it’s rainy, windy and very quiet..

But, those who are on St. George Island say they’ve made it safely and they’re staying..

“We were hoping for sunny skies and fishing trips,” said Chad Belknap..

Belknap’s trip to the coast isn’t quite what he was expecting, but after a 14-hour drive from Oklahoma, he isn’t going anywhere..

“I haven’t seen the ocean in probably close to 10 years and I definitely haven’t seen it rough like this..

On Monday, the double-red flags were up, meaning no one is allowed in the water..

“Being from Tennessee, this is our first time in this kind of weather,” said Edward Griffith, another visitor on the island..

“We were on the third floor of our house trying to sleep and just imagining all kinds of things..

It really wasn’t that bad when we woke up this morning, just a lot of wind, a lot of rain.”.

Griffith says they’ll continue riding out the storm, hoping for a break in the waves and sunny skies..

Franklin County Emergency Management will continue to provide updates on social media..

Earlier Monday afternoon, officials were warning residents, especially those near the coastline, to be prepared for flooding and to take it slow when driving in the area..

BILOXI, Miss. (WLOX) - Across South Mississippi, vacationers have had to pack their bags early and leave town..

Hurricane Sally has emptied both the hotels and the casinos with her threat of rain and storm surge..

After riding out Hurricane Laura in Monroe, La.,, they hoped they could come to Mississippi to relax..

“It was pretty rough (during Laura), we had up to 90 mile-per-hour winds..

The family had plans to go to Ship Island Monday but had to settle for photos in front of the high surf being pushed ashore by Hurricane Sally..

“They called us the day before and said they had to cancel because of the storm coming in, so we’ve just been hanging out,” Duncan said..

Parker Walker of Laurel and her family were celebrating her ninth birthday until they were told they had to evacuate..

“We were at Margaritaville, but everybody had to leave,” said Parker’s sister Tyler Gavin..

“So we just brought them to the beach so they could enjoy themselves, then we’re going to leave.”.

With casinos closing and hotels canceling reservations, the tourism market will take a brief hit, but if Sally doesn’t cause too much damage, they expect to be back in full swing by next weekend..

As a reminder, county officials have closed the beaches, saying it’s too dangerous for people to be in the water due to a possible storm surge..

Monday morning forecast suggests 30-40 mph winds, 3-6 inches of rain - The Bogalusa Daily News.

The National Weather Service released its latest statement about Tropical Storm Sally on Monday morning at 4:21 a.m..

A hurricane warning remains in effect for Washington Parish..

The latest local forecast suggests the possibility of “equivalent tropical storm force wind,” with 30-40 mph and gusts as high as 55 mph..

These winds are forecast for Tuesday morning until Wednesday morning..

The NWS also states that there is a “threat to life and property that includes typical forecast uncertainty in track, size and intensity.”.

There is a potential for wind as high as 74-110 mph, depending on Sally’s future track and potential growth..

Other information from the forecast includes:  The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the previous assessment..

Plan — Plan for the possibility of life-threatening wind of equivalent category 1 or 2 hurricane force..

Prepare — Remaining efforts to protect life and property should be urgently completed..

Act — Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous..

The forecast lists several “potential impacts,” including:  Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having window, door, and garage door failures leading to structural damage..

Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed..

Many large trees snapped or uprooted, along with fences and roadway signs blown over..

Some roads may be impassable from large debris, and more within urban or heavily wooded places..

Several bridges, causeways, and access routes may be impassable..

Large areas may have power and communications outages..

A flash flood watch is in effect, with peak rainfall of 3-6 inches, but potentially higher amounts..

Hurricane Sally crawling towards Gulf Coast; SC expected to see rain Thursday.

CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - Hurricane Sally is slowly moving towards the Gulf Coast at 3 mph as outer rain bands move onshore in the Florida Panhandle late Monday night..

The National Hurricane Center says Sally, a Category 2 Hurricane, is likely to produce extremely dangerous and life-threatening storm surge and flash flooding along portions of the northern Gulf coast.

The eventual remnants of Sally is expected to bring rain to the Lowcountry at the end of this week as it’s expected to move to the east toward the Carolinas..

Live 5 Meteorologist Danielle Prinz said South Carolina is expected to start feeling the effects of Sally on Wednesday with rain, and by Thursday and Friday we could see some heavy rain with 1 to 4 in.

The latest forecast model shows most of the heaviest rain occurring in the Upstate..

On Monday night, Hurricane Sally was located about 90 miles east of the Mississippi River..

Sally is moving toward the west-northwest at 3 mph, and this motion is expected to continue through Tuesday morning..

Forecasts say a northward turn is likely by Tuesday afternoon, and a slow north-northeastward to northeastward motion is expected Tuesday night through Wednesday night..

“On the forecast track, the center of Sally will move near the coast of southeastern Louisiana tonight and Tuesday, and make landfall in the hurricane warning area Tuesday night or Wednesday,” NHC off.

pic.twitter.com/LB86TUPJP2 — Live 5 First Alert Weather (@LIVE5WEATHER) September 15, 2020  Tropical Storm Vicky, the fifth active named system currently being monitored, is about 455 miles west-north.

Vicky is moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h)..

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph with higher gusts..

Meteorologists said gradual weakening is anticipated, and Vicky is forecast to become a remnant low during the next day or two..

Live 5 Meteorologist Joey Sovine says the last time there were five active named systems at the same time in the Atlantic was in September 1971..

That leaves only the name Wilfred left on the 2020 Atlantic hurricane names list..

After that name is used, any future named storms this season will take letters from the Greek alphabet..

The only other time that happened was during the 2005 hurricane season, which had six storms named with Greek letters..

Tropical Storm Teddy is forecast to become a hurricane on Tuesday and is expected to gradually strengthen as it turns northwestward on Wednesday..

“This early turn is good news and models are in good agreement,” Live 5 Chief Meteorologist Bill Walsh said late Monday night..

“It’s unlikely Teddy will affect land, but we will continue to monitor.”.

On Tuesday night, Teddy was about 1,100 miles east of the Lesser Antilles..

A west-northwestward motion at a slower forward speed is expected overnight through Tuesday night, followed by a northwestward motion Wednesday and Thursday..

Forecasters are keeping their eye on two other named systems along with three others that have varying degrees of development potential..

Hurricane Paulette was near Bermuda on Monday where a hurricane warning is in effect..

But Paulette is expected to make a turn to the north after its eye passes over Bermuda..

But despite its distance from the U.S. coastline, Paulette was contributing to a higher risk of rip currents off the Lowcountry coast..

On Sunday, three people, including two children, were rescued after they were caught in rip currents off Folly Beach..

EMS took a woman and a 6-year-old child to the hospital after the incident..

Rene was downgraded to a tropical depression over the weekend and is expected to dissipate into a remnant low by Wednesday..

Forecasters are watching two other systems with a lower chance of development so far..

The first is a weak area of low pressure over the west-central Gulf of Mexico producing limited shower activity..

Forecasters say the chance this system would develop into a tropical depression or tropical storm is not likely because of strong upper-level winds..

The National Hurricane Center gives it only a 10 percent chance of developing over the next five days..

The second, however, is a tropical wave near the west coast of Africa producing disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity..

Environmental conditions may help the wave slowly develop this week as it moves westward at about 10 mph over the far eastern tropical Atlantic..

Forecasters say there is a 40 percent chance for development over the next five days..

Hurricane Sally threatens Gulf Coast with 85 mph winds, 9-foot surge as tropics busy with 6 more systems.

Hurricane Sally lost some steam overnight, but is still a strong Category 1 hurricane with 85 mph winds as it slogs its way closer to the Gulf Coast bringing with it a threat of 9-foot storm surge, up.

Meanwhile, the tropics continue to remain active with Hurricane Paulette, Tropical Storm Teddy and Tropical Storm Vicky in the Atlantic as well as three more areas with a chance to form into the next .

Sally had on Monday grown to a Category 2 hurricane with 100 mph winds, but died back down to Category 1 status and is not projected to gain in strength before landfall..

The slow-moving storm, though, will bring a tremendous threat of heavy rain, from 10-20 inches with some isolated areas of 30 inches from the central Gulf Coast to the western Florida Panhandle..

Advertisement  “Historic flooding is possible with extreme life-threatening flash flooding likely through Wednesday,” Stewart said..

“In addition, this rainfall will lead to widespread moderate to major flooding on area rivers.”.

As it moves inland, that flood threat will expand across the Southeast with 4-8 inches and some areas up to 12 inches across portions of southeastern Mississippi, southern and central Alabama, norther.

Some tornadoes could occur Monday morning in the northeast quadrant of the hurricane over the Florida Panhandle and Alabama, with the threat increasing inland later Monday and into Tuesday..

State of emergency for Escambia, Santa Rosa counties, in preparation for Hurricane Sally.

UPDATE: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday expanded an executive order related to Hurricane Sally to include the counties of Escambia, Santa Rosa, Bay, Calhoun, Franklin, Gadsden, Gulf, Holmes, Jackson, Lib.

With Hurricane Sally rolling into the Gulf of Mexico, Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday declared a state of emergency for Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in the Florida Panhandle..

Monday, the incoming hurricane strengthened to a Category 2 hurricane — another storm in the busy 2020 hurricane season..

The Weather Channel projects that “life-threatening storm surge is expected, particularly in parts of southeast Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.”.

For Florida, Hurricane Sally is expecting heavy rain and flooding to the northwest counties..

Escambia has already issued a volunteer evacuation for certain areas and could see a storm surge of two to four feet, according to the Pensacola News Journal..

“Now, we don’t necessarily expect hurricane force winds in those areas at this time,” DeSantis said..

“But we think it’s very likely that there will be tropical storm force winds in those areas.”.

He is concerned about the storm slowing down in that area, which he said could “dump up to 25 inches of rain in those Northwest Florida counties.”.

The Weather Channel reports that “Flooding rain is a major threat from Sally on the Gulf Coast and farther inland across the Southeast this week.”.

DeSantis addressed the potential of needing to add more counties to the state of emergency should Hurricane Sally change course and push further east..

For now, he asks the citizens of Escambia and Santa Rosa to listen to their local officials for updates on how to address Hurricane Sally and to evacuate if they are advised to do so..

Sally could make landfall as 'dangerous' Category 2 hurricane: What it means for Mississippi.

Hurricane Sally is now a Category 2 storm with "additional strengthening" possible Monday night and Tuesday morning..

The National Hurricane Center said the storm is expected to make landfall as a "dangerous hurricane.".

Sally is forecast to approach southeastern Louisiana on Monday night and Tuesday morning and will make landfall in the hurricane warning area — from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Navarre, Florida — late .

Hurricane Sally is currently a Category 2 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph..

Should Sally continue to strengthen, it could become a Category 3 storm with winds of at least 111 mph, according to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale..

Sally is the earliest named "S" storm on record, beating out Stan in 2005..

There is only one more named storm, Wilfred, left of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season before the Greek alphabet is activated for names..

This will be the third hurricane to make landfall on the U.S. Gulf Coast after Hanna made hit near Corpus Christi, Texas, in July and Laura near Lake Charles, Louisiana, in August..

A hurricane reaches Category 2 status when its maximum sustained winds reach 96 mph..

Storms are considered Category 3 "major" hurricanes when winds reach at least 111 mph..

Hurricane Sally is expected to bring "extremely dangerous and life-threatening" storm surge to the U.S. Gulf Coast..

Storm surge could reach the following heights above ground in Mississippi if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide:  Mouth of the Mississippi River to Ocean Springs, including Lake Borgne: 7-.

A "major" hurricane is any hurricane ranked as a Category 3, 4 or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale..

These are hurricanes with sustained winds of at least 111 mph or more than 157 mph..

Major hurricanes cause devastating and catastrophic damage..

A Category 2 storm brings extremely dangerous winds that cause extensive damage, according to the Saffir-Simpson scale..

Well-constructed frame homes could sustain major roof and siding damage, while shallowly rooted trees could be snapped or uprooted and block numerous roads..

Loss of power is expected that could last from several days to weeks..

A Category 3 storm could cause severe damage to well-built framed homes, according to the Saffir-Simpson scale..

Most of the roof structure could be lost along with exterior walls..

Hurricane Katrina made landfall in August 2005 and strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of making its second landfall as a Category 3 in Louisiana and Mississippi..

Hurricane Elena made landfall in Biloxi, Mississippi, as a Category 3 in September 1985..

Hurricane Nate made landfall in October 2017 as a Category 1 first at the mouth of the Mississippi River and then near Biloxi and caused $787 million in damage  Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Augu.

There are currently 7 active tropical systems over sea, but Texas is spared for now.

The National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on Rene at 5 p.m. Monday..

It is no longer a tropical storm, and its remnants are expected to dissipate over the Atlantic in the next day or two..

Original story:  They go by Paulette, Rene, Sally, Teddy, Vicky, and they’re contributing to one of the most active hurricane seasons on record..

Those tropical systems are joined by a disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico and another disturbance off the coast of western Africa, for a total of seven active systems brewing..

For now, none is expected to affect Texas any time soon, but that’s not the case for Louisiana, which is bracing for Hurricane Sally..

The hurricane was blowing winds of up to 85 mph Monday morning, and it is expected to strengthen before making landfall Tuesday in southeastern Louisiana..

There were seven active tropical systems across the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico on Monday, Sept. 14..

(National Hurricane Center)  The National Hurricane Center warned that Sally would likely produce a life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and flash flooding along portions of the Gulf C.

Sally is expected to dump as much 18 inches of rain in portions of Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, and could create a storm surge as high as 11 feet at the mouth of the Mississippi River, accordin.

“Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions,” Brown said in a forecast update..

A Hurricane Warning for #Sally is in effect from Morgan City, Louisiana to the Alabama/Florida border, including New Orleans..

Tropical-storm-force winds will likely begin later today and this evening..

pic.twitter.com/mgwJ4ZId02 — National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) September 14, 2020  Ahead of the storm, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell issued a mandatory evacuation order for those living in.

At the request of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deployed state resources on Monday to Louisiana to assist with Sally..

A search-and-rescue team of 80 people with six boats will head to Louisiana..

“As our friends in Louisiana prepare for [Hurricane] Sally, the State of Texas is ready to assist in response and recovery efforts,” Abbott said in a written statement..

“I ask all Texans to pray for those in the path of this storm..

Our neighbors in Louisiana were there for us during Hurricane Harvey, and we will be here for them as Tropical Storm Sally nears their shores.”.

Tropical Storm Vicky, which formed Monday morning, became the 20th named storm of hurricane season..

Usually by mid-September, which is considered the peak of hurricane season, there are about seven named storms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration..

Some years, there aren’t more than 15 named storms in a given season, according to NOAA..

After Vicky, the next available name on the list of 2020 storms is Wilfred..

After Wilfred, NOAA will run out of storm names and use the Greek alphabet to name storms..

The Greek alphabet has been used for storm names once before, in 2005, according to the hurricane center..

Winds have increased and Hurricane Sally is now a cat 2 hurricane..

Further strengthening is expected tonight and Sally could attempt to become a cat 3 hurricane..

At cat 3, a hurricane becomes labeled as a “major hurricane.”.

Sally should make landfall tomorrow night along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, if not a bit farther east on the Alabama Gulf Coast..

The track continues to shift ever so slightly eastward and now the Mobile, Alabama area is really under the gun..

Flooding rainfall is the main threat,especially as slowly as Sally is moving..

Some locations could receive more than two feet of rain..

I have a feeling the flooding is going to be the big, big story..

I also wouldn’t be surprised if rainfall amounts aren’t being underestimated..

An eye is trying to form in Sally and that should become clearer in the coming hours..

I’ll share those images as soon as they become available..

The latest rainfall forecast for Sally is quite impressive..

Now that Sally is getting bigger and stronger, she should be able to throw some rain our way by Wednesday night and Thursday..

We’re not looking at much, but it could make for higher rain chances for us..

I’m keeping an eye on it all and I’ll keep you posted on the latest!.

Tropical Storm Sally Expected to Strengthen and Could Strike Louisiana and Mississippi as a Hurricane.

Tropical Storm Sally expected to make landfall as a hurricane near New Orleans.

(CNN) Tropical Storm Sally could be a Category 2 hurricane when it reaches the United States near New Orleans on Tuesday morning..

Hurricane warnings have now been issued from Morgan City, Louisiana, east to Ocean Springs, Mississippi, including New Orleans, Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas..

Sally continues to strengthen across the Gulf of Mexico with sustained winds of 60 mph..

Storm surges of up to 7 to 11 feet are possible near the center of the storm and just east of where landfall is expected..

Along with storm surge, extreme rainfall amounts of over a foot are expected in some locations between southeast Louisiana and the western Florida panhandle..

Tropical Storm Sally is the 18th named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, the earliest 18th-named storm on record ..

On Saturday, the storm brought heavy rain and gusty winds to south Florida as it moved into the Gulf of Mexico..

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Saturday evening ahead of Sally's arrival, and on Sunday, he said he had spoken with President Donald Trump and will submit a pre-landfall.

"While we ultimately don't know where Sally will make landfall, much of Southeast Louisiana is in the storm's cone and the risk of tropical storm force or hurricane strength winds continues to increas.

This storm has the potential to be very serious," Edwards said in a news release..

We "have every reason to believe that this storm represents a very significant threat to the people of Southeast Louisiana," Edwards said at a press conference Sunday..

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves signed a preliminary state of emergency for the state, he said Sunday, and has also sent a request to the President "to provide the necessary guidance" for pre-landfall ac.

In New Orleans, Mayor LaToya Cantrell issued a mandatory evacuation order for residents outside of the city's levee protection system..

The evacuation will begin Sunday at 6 p.m. for the areas of Venetian Isles, Irish Bayou and Lake Catherine..

Cantrell said Sunday that sandbags were available throughout the city and that water pumps are in place and operational..

In coastal Louisiana, Grand Isle and St. Charles Parish are under mandatory evacuation declarations, and a recommended evacuation notice went out to the community of Port Fourchon..

"We want residents to heed our warnings and make preparations to leave now," St. Charles Parish President Matthew Jewell said on the official Facebook page of St. Charles Parish..

Three jails with 1,200 inmates in total have been evacuated, Edwards said Sunday, and at least one nursing home is evacuating..

Gulf Coast expecting 6 to 12 inches of rain  Flash flood watches are in effect along the Gulf Coast across much of southern Louisiana, east to the Florida Panhandle, and along the western Florida peni.

These watches include the city of New Orleans, Biloxi, Mississippi, Mobile, Alabama, and Panama City and Tampa, Florida..

Sally is expected to slow in speed as it approaches the Gulf Coast which will result in significant flash flooding across the region..

Widespread rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches is expected along the Gulf Coast through Wednesday, but isolated rainfall of up to 20 inches is not out of the question..

The combination of extreme rainfall and the high storm surge will bring widespread flooding to much of the Gulf Coast beginning on Monday and lasting at least through Wednesday..

Most forecast models have Sally moving toward the northern Gulf Coast and likely making landfall somewhere between New Orleans and Panama City by late Monday or Tuesday..

However, if the track shifts farther west or slows down, landfall may hold off until Wednesday..

"The cyclone will likely become a hurricane in 2 to 3 days, although an increase in vertical shear could slow the rate of intensification over the northern Gulf of Mexico," according to the National H.

Once it reaches that area of the Gulf Coast the steering patterns break down and the system meanders near the coast..

Whether the meandering is offshore prior to a landfall or onshore will not make much of a difference in terms of rainfall..

In either case, because of the slow forward movement along the Gulf Coast significant flooding is possible..

Active hurricane season stays busy  Another system, Tropical Depression Twenty, formed in the central tropical Atlantic on Saturday, according to the NHC..

Twenty is expected to strengthen to a tropical storm by Sunday evening and a hurricane by Tuesday, and if so, will be named Teddy..

The previous record for the earliest 19th named storm is October 4, 2005..

Many storms broke records for being the earliest named to date..

All but three named storms (Arthur, Bertha and Dolly) set records for being the earliest named storm for their respective letter..

After Sally, there are only three names left on this year's official list: Teddy, Vicky, and Wilfred..

After that, the NHC will move on to using the Greek alphabet..

Sally is just one of several systems in the Atlantic..

The NHC is currently watching seven areas: one hurricane, one tropical storm, two tropical depressions and three tropical disturbances..

Thursday marked the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season..

Hurricane Paulette is forecast to track toward Bermuda and potentially make landfall early Monday morning as a category 2 storm..

Overnight hurricane forecasters changed their guidance slightly to show the storm is now likely to reach Category 2 strength with maximum sustained winds of approximately 100 mph and the possibility o.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Saturday, and officials in the New Orleans area issued a mandatory evacuation order for areas outside of levee protection..

The tropical storm had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) with higher gusts, forecasters said..

Sally was expected to strengthen into a hurricane Monday and reach the coast late Monday and Tuesday..

Storm surge from Sally was forecast to reach dangerous levels, due in part to the tide..

Up to 11 feet (3.4 meters) of water was predicted from the mouth of the Mississippi River to Ocean Springs, Mississippi, including Lake Borgne..

A slow moving storm, Sally could produce rain totals up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) by the middle of the week, forecasters said..

The system was moving west-northwest at 13 mph (20 kph) early Sunday..

It was centered 115 miles (190 kilometers) west of Port Charlotte, Florida, and 345 miles (550 kilometers) east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River..

Sally Strengthening; Likely to Make Landfall Monday or Tuesday as a Hurricane.

As of the 8 AM EDT advisory maximum sustained winds had increased to 50 mph and the pressure had dropped to 996 mb..

Movement is currently to the west-northwest at 13 mph..

A turn to the northwest and then north is expected tomorrow/Tuesday..

Forecast for Sally  Landfall is likely to occur in southeast Louisiana or south Mississippi late Monday or sometime Tuesday..

Model guidance, including the ECMWF and GFS, are in good agreement on this..

However, there is still time for slight adjustments in track both west and east..

Over the next day or two Sally will be traversing an environment with low wind shear and sea surface temperatures of 29 to 30 degrees Celsius..

This will support intensification, and Sally is likely to become a hurricane..

The official forecast from the National Hurricane Center has Sally making landfall as a 100 mph category 2 hurricane..

However, rapid intensification can’t be ruled out, and it is possible Sally could make a run at major hurricane status (category 3 or higher)..

It should also be noted an uptick in shear is expected as Sally nears landfall, and this could cause intensification to level off..

Impacts  Sally will bring a storm surge of 4 to 11′ from Port Fourchon, LA to Ocean Springs, MS.  Hurricane-force winds (> 74 mph) will also be likely in southeast Louisiana and south Mississippi with.

Tropical-storm-force winds (> 39 mph) will be possible along the Florida Panhandle..

In addition, 6 to 15″ of rain will be likely in southeast Louisiana, south Mississippi, south Alabama, and the western Florida Panhandle..

Sally is expected to slow down substantially near/after landfall..

This is likely to exacerbate the issue of heavy rain, flash flooding, and storm surge..

There will also be the possibility for waterspouts/isolated tornadoes with outer bands/squalls..

Sally has rapidly strengthened to a hurricane, Gulf Coast residents get ready.

The National Hurricane Center says Sally has rapidly strengthened to a hurricane, sustaining top winds of around 85 mph..

Storm-weary Gulf Coast residents rushed to finish last-minute preparations Monday as Hurricane Sally chugged slowly through warm Gulf waters..

Forecasters said the biggest threat is flooding, with as much as two feet of rain falling in some areas..

"The bottom line continues to be that Sally is expected to be a dangerous slow-moving hurricane near the coast of southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama during the next 2-3 days," the Nationa.

Sally is perhaps the least welcome guest among lots of company: For only the second time in recorded history, meteorologist Philip Klotzbach said, there are five tropical cyclones churning in the Atla.

Jeremy Burke was lifting things off the floor in case of flooding in his Bay Books bookstore in the Old Town neighborhood of Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, a popular weekend getaway from New Orleans, abo.

"Everybody's biggest fear is the storm surge, and the worst possible scenario being that it just stalls out..

"  The National Hurricane Center said it was too early to tell exactly where Sally would come ashore, because it's still not known when it would make a turn to the north..

At 10 a.m. local time, it was about 135 miles (220 kilometers) east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River..

A hurricane-hunter aircraft crew said it was strengthening rapidly, to top winds of 85 mph (140 kmh)..

Sally is expected to reach shore by early Tuesday, bringing dangerous weather conditions, including risk of flooding, to a region stretching from the western Florida Panhandle to southeast Louisiana..

"That system is forecast to bring not only damaging winds but a dangerous storm surge," said Daniel Brown of the Hurricane Center..

"Because it's slowing down, it could produce a tremendous amount of rainfall over the coming days.".

Sally could produce rain totals up to 24 inches (61 centimeters) by the middle of the week, forecasters said..

People in New Orleans were watching the storm's track intently..

A more easterly landfall would likely bring the heavier rains and damaging winds onto the Mississippi coast, or east of that..

Already outer bands from the storm were hitting the Florida Panhandle..

A more westerly track would pose another test for the low-lying city, where heavy rains have to be pumped out through a century-old drainage system..

Officials with the Sewerage and Water Board said Sunday that all of the pumps were in operation ahead of the storm, but the aging system is susceptible to breakdowns..

The Hurricane Center warned of an "extremely dangerous and life-threatening storm surge" for areas outside the levee protection system that protects the greater New Orleans area stretching from Port F.

Tropical Storm Sally formed Saturday off south Florida, becoming the earliest 18th-named storm on record in an Atlantic hurricane season as it enters the Gulf of Mexico amid signs of strengthening fur.

Tropical Storm Sally forecast to become a hurricane. Will it affect our weather?.

NASHVILLE, Tenn (WKRN) – Tropical Storm Sally formed in the southeast Gulf of Mexico Saturday afternoon after crossing the south tip of Florida as a tropical depression..

Sustained winds as of Sunday morning were 50 mph with gusts to 60 mph..

The National Hurricane Center is forecasting Sally to become a Category 2 Hurricane Monday night and make landfall along the Central Gulf Coast early in the morning on Tuesday..

Although the center of the forecast track brings it into southeast Louisiana and south Mississippi, it should be noted (especially this far out in time) that the cone of uncertainty stretches from wes.

For Middle Tennessee and South Kentucky, the question is, will it affect our weather?.

But with the forecast track as it is, we should receive rain from the system on Thursday afternoon and night, along with breezy conditions..

If the system stays to our south, we could be spared from some of the heaviest rainfall and severe weather risk, BUT a deviation in the path could change that..

Tropical Storm Sally expected to become a hurricane with destructive landfall for the Gulf Coast.

There are now 6 tropical systems ongoing in the Atlantic tropical region..

Tropical Storm Sally, located near the Florida Keys is expected to significantly intensify over the Gulf of Mexico and head for a destructive landfall as a hurricane at the Gulf Coast..

The system could possibly bring destructive flooding, storm surge, and hurricane-force winds into the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, or southwest Florida..

Gulf Coast under a hurricane watch  Hurricane Watch has been issued from Grand Isle, Louisiana to the Alabama/Florida border, including Metropolitan New Orleans for Tuesday..

There is a mandatory evacuation order for residents outside of the New Orleans’ levee protection system, for the areas of Venetian Isles, Irish Bayou, and Lake Catherine..

Tropical Storm Sally has formed near southern Florida and southeast portions of the Gulf of Mexico today..

It is currently packing winds of 35 knots (40 mph) with the minimum central pressure of 1004 mbar..

Sally has set the new record – the earliest 18th named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season..

Breaking the previous record set by Stan back on October 2nd, 2005..

Satellite analysis  Both Infrared and Visible satellite channels are indicating that fuel for the storms is very high..

Explosive storms are ongoing around the forming/deepening low around the Florida Keys and the southeastern Gulf of Mexico..

The water vapor imagery indicates the upper-level outflow ventilation is healthy..

This is calling for a very favorable environment for further strengthening on Sunday and Monday..

Sally continues to gradually become better organized, with developing convective banding features primarily over the southern portion of the circulation at this time..

Favorable warm waters of the Gulf  Very warm 30-31 °C Gulf of Mexico sea waters are observed, which will support fuel for explosive storms associated with Sally..

A faster rate of intensification is forecast to begin on Sunday..

And potentially rapid on Monday into Tuesday when the systems will be approaching the Gulf Coast..

Tropical waters of the Western Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico are well above the long-term average, from 1-2 °C above normal..

Forecast Track  Weather models are hinting Sally to become a hurricane by Monday while moving toward the Gulf Coast..

The landfall is likely somewhere between New Orleans (Louisiana) and Panama City (Florida) by Tuesday..

First, Sally is expected to produce flash flooding across portions of southern Florida and prolong existing minor river flooding across central Florida through Sunday..

Flash, urban, and minor to moderate river flooding is likely across portions of the central Gulf Coast from Sunday through the middle of next week..

Here is NAM-model forecast for the wind potential along Sally while moving from southern Florida across the Gulf of Mexico towards the coast of Louisiana:  Very warm waters and a moist tropospheric en.

Some increase in westerly shear over the northern Gulf in 48-72 hours could at least slow down the intensification process around that time..

Sally will likely reach at least a solid Category 1 strength, NHC is forecasting 75 knots (85 mph) prior to landfall on Tuesday..

However, some models are rising the potential that Sally could become even stronger..

Destructive winds, storm surge and flooding likely  The most likely arrival times of dangerous winds into the Gulf Coast are from Monday morning onwards..

Once Sally intensifies into a hurricane, it is likely to develop extremely dangerous and life-threatening potential for storm surge, destructive winds and flooding along the Gulf Coast..

Various models are hinting there will be an enormous amount of rain over the 5 days, more than 10 inches (250 mm) is expected..

Some models, e.g. the European ECMWF are even simulating more than 500 mm (20 inches)..

Another concern is the potentially life-threatening storm surge along the Gulf Coast beginning on Monday..

A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for areas outside the southeast Louisiana Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System from the Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Alabama/Florida border..

Around 1-3 feet storm surge is possible along the south-southwest Florida, 2-6 feel along southern Alabama and Mississippi and up to 9 feet for southeastern Louisiana..

Extremely active 2020 season  After Sally, there are then only three names left on the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season list..

Teddy, Vicky, and Wilfred are the last names reserved for this year..

When these three names are used, the National Hurricane Center will begin using the Greek alphabet..

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Tropical Storm Sally formed Saturday off south Florida amid forecasts it would reach hurricane strength early in the week before striking the northern Gulf Coast with high .

The earliest 18th-named storm in an Atlantic tropical season, Sally already was better organized within hours of forming and was expected to become a hurricane by late Monday, the National Hurricane C.

New Orleans and surrounding areas, along with a stretch of the coast from Grand isle, Louisiana, to the Alabama-Florida line, were placed under a hurricane watch..

The National Hurricane Center said dangerous storm surge was possible along the northern Gulf Coast starting Monday and that hurricane conditions could set in there starting early Tuesday..

The Miami-based center said Sally spent Saturday afternoon sending gusty winds and heavy rains over south Florida..

By nightfall, Sally was centered about 45 miles (70 kilometers) west of Naples, Florida, and about 455 miles (735 kilometers) east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River..

The storm was crawling away from south Florida into the Gulf at a pace of 8 mph (13 kph), heading in a west-northwest direction..

Elsewhere, Tropical Storm Paulette had maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph) and was 415 miles (670 kilometers) southeast of Bermuda, where a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning are in ef.

Tropical Storm “Sally” strengthening, hurricane and storm surge warnings issued for portions of the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Tropical Storm "Sally" formed at 18:00 UTC on September 12, 2020, as the earliest 18th named Atlantic storm, beating the previous record set by Stan on September 22, 2005..

At the time it formed, Sally's center was located about 60 km (35 miles) SSE of Naples, Florida..

Before it was officially named, Sally was known as Tropical Depression 19 — TD19 made landfall at 06:00 UTC on September 12 just south of Miami, Florida with winds of 55 km/h (35 mph) and a pressure o.

Life-threatening storm surge is possible along the Gulf Coast beginning on Monday, and a Storm Surge Watch is in effect for areas outside the southeastern Louisiana Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Red.

Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by local officials..

Sally is expected to produce flash flooding across portions of southern Florida and prolong existing minor river flooding across central Florida through Sunday..

Flash and urban flooding and minor to moderate river flooding are likely across portions of the central Gulf Coast from Sunday through the middle of next week..

At 06:00 UTC on September 13 (02:00 EDT), the center of Tropical Storm "Sally" was located about 130 km (80 miles) WSW of Port Charlotte, Florida, and 620 km (385 miles) ESE of the Mouth of the Missis.

The storm had maximum sustained winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) and minimum central pressure of 1 003 hPa..

Further strengthening is expected over the next couple of days, and Sally is forecast to become a hurricane on Monday, with some additional strengthening possible through early Tuesday..

A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for the Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Alabama/Florida Border, Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and Lake Borgne, Mobile Bay..

A Hurricane Watch is in effect for Grand Isle Louisiana to the Alabama/Florida border, Lake Pontchartrain, and Lake Maurepas including metropolitan New Orleans..

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Alabama/Florida Border to Ochlockonee River Florida..

On the NHC forecast track, the center of Sally will move over the southeastern and eastern Gulf of Mexico today, September 13, move over the north-central Gulf of Mexico Sunday night and Monday, Septe.

Tropical Storm "Sally" at 06:50 UTC on September 13, 2020..

Credit: NOAA/GOES-16, RAMMB/CIRA  "Given the current structure, only gradual strengthening is expected in the short term..

However, once the cyclone develops more of an inner core, it should be able to take advantage of warm sea surface temperatures and low shear over the Gulf of Mexico during the next couple of days," NH.

Steady intensification to hurricane strength is forecast through 48 hours, with a leveling off of the intensity in 60 – 72 hours as the shear is expected to increase..

"  "Users are reminded to not focus on the exact details of the track or intensity forecasts, as the average NHC track error at 72 h is around 177 km (110 miles) and the average intensity error is aro.

In addition, wind, storm surge, and rainfall hazards will extend far from the center..

Unfortunately, confidence is increasing that Sally's expected slow forward speed near the Gulf Coast will exacerbate the storm surge and heavy rainfall threats..

"  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline, NHC forecasters warned..

The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide:  Mouth of the Mississippi River to Ocean Springs, MS, inclu.

Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL Border: 1.2 – 1.8 m (4 – 6 feet)..

MS/AL Border to AL/FL Border, including Mobile Bay: 0.6 – 1.8 m (2 – 4 feet)..

Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas: 0.6 – 1.8 m (2 – 4 feet)..

AL/FL Border to Chassahowitzka, FL, including Pensacola Bay, Choctawhatchee Bay, and Saint Andrew Bay: 0.3 – 0.9 m (1 – 3 feet)..

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the right of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and damaging waves..

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances..

Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area by early Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions possible within the watch areas by Monday..

Wind gusts to tropical storm force are possible across the lower Florida Keys overnight..

Sally is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts of 50 – 100 mm (2 to 4 inches) with locally higher amounts possible over southern Florida and the Florida Keys through today..

Rainfall amounts of 50 – 100 mm (2 to 4 inches) with isolated amounts of 150 mm (6 inches) are expected along the west coast of Florida through today..

This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding across southern Florida and prolong high flows and ongoing minor flooding on rivers across central Florida..

Sally is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 125 – 250 mm (5 to 10 inches) across the Florida Panhandle, and 150 – 300 mm (6 to 12 inches) with isolated amounts of 460 mm (18 inches) over the Cent.

Sally is expected to be a slow-moving system that will continue to produce heavy rainfall and considerable flooding near the central Gulf Coast through the middle of next week..

Flash, urban, and rapid onset flooding along small streams and minor to moderate flooding on rivers are likely..

Swells will spread northward along the west-central coast of Florida and reach the Florida Panhandle and the northern Gulf Coast during the next couple of days..

These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions..

A tornado is possible overnight along the south Florida Gulf Coast..

Hurricane, storm surge warnings issued for parts of Gulf Coast as Sally strengthens.

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — The National Weather Service has issued hurricane and storm surge warnings for parts of the northern Gulf Coast as Tropical Storm Sally strengthens off the west coast of Florida..

The tropics remain extremely active Sunday with Tropical Storm Sally, Hurricane Paulette, Tropical Depression Rene and Tropical Depression 20 all churning along with two other disturbances and another.

Tropical Storm Sally  Tropical Storm Sally strengthened again Sunday morning and now has maximum sustained wind speeds of 50 mph..

The National Hurricane Center says the storm should strengthen to a hurricane on Monday..

As of 5 a.m., Sally is about 115 miles west of Port Charlotte, Florida and moving west-northwest at about 13 mph..

The tropical storm is forecast to continue moving in that direction until it slows down and makes a turn toward the north-northwest on Tuesday..

The NHC says Sally will move over the Gulf of Mexico Sunday and Monday before approaching the north-central Gulf Coast late Monday or Tuesday..

Storm Surge Warning in effect for:  Port Fourchon, Louisiana to the Mississippi/Alabama Border  Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas and Lake Borgne  Hurricane Warning in effect for:  Grand Isle, Louisia.

As of 5 a.m., Paulette was a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph..

The storm is about 310 miles southeast of Bermuda and moving west-northwest at about 14 mph..

Paulette is forecast to start bringing strong winds, storm surge and heavy rain to Bermuda by Sunday evening before moving over or near the island territory early Monday morning..

According to the latest NHC forecast, Paulette is expected to be a “dangerous hurricane” when it approaches Bermuda..

Tropical Depression Rene  As of 5 a.m. Sunday, Rene remains a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph..

Tropical Depression 20  Tropical Depression 20 is about 1745 miles east of the Lesser Antilles as of 5 a.m. Sunday, according to the National Hurricane Center..

The system is expected to continue its current movement toward the west-northwest for the next few days..

As of Sunday morning, Tropical Depression 20 has maximum sustained winds of 35 mph..

Strengthening is expected over the next several days..

Forecasters expect it to become a tropical storm by Tuesday and say it could potentially become a hurricane after that..

Other areas to watch  In addition to the tropical depressions, tropical storm and hurricane, the NHC is also monitoring three other areas in the Atlantic basin for potential development..

The first is a trough over the west-central Gulf of Mexico that’s producing some shower activity as of Sunday morning..

The NHC says slow development of the system is possible but strong upper-level winds associated with Sally will likely limit the chance of formation..

The disturbance is expected to move southwestward and then southward over the west-central and southwestern Gulf over the next few days..

The second area being monitored is an area of showers and thunderstorms near the Cabo Verde Islands that the NHC says is associated with a broad area of low pressure..

The latest forecast says environmental conditions do support some additional development and a tropical depression could form in the coming days as the system moves west-northwest..

Upper-level winds are expected to become less conducive for development by mid-week..

The NHC has given the disturbance a medium 60 percent chance of formation through the next 48 hours and a high 70 percent chance of formation over the next five days..

The third area being watched is a tropical wave that’s forecast to emerge off the west coast of Africa this week..

The NHC says gradual development of the system is possible as it moves over the Atlantic..

It has been given a low, near zero percent chance of formation in the next 48 hours and a low 20 percent chance of formation in the next five days..

Tropical Storm Sally Hurricane Warning Central Gulf Coast Hurricane Paulette Hurricane Warning Bermuda.

Tropical Storm Sally Hurricane Warning Central Gulf Coast  Hurricane Paulette Hurricane Warning Bermuda  Tropical Storm Sally has strengthened overnight and is on its way to becoming a hurricane befor.

Hurricane Warnings are up from Grand Isle Louisiana to the Alabama Florida border..

The big question for Sally is how much will Sally strengthen before landfall..

The interaction with the Florida Peninsula is lessening though heavy rains continue today up and down the west coast of Florida..

If Sally forms a solid core, it could begin to strengthen rapidly tonight and Monday..

8AM LOCATION…27.3N 84.6W  ABOUT 155 MI…250 KM W OF PORT CHARLOTTE FLORIDA  ABOUT 300 MI…485 KM ESE OF THE MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER  MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS…50 MPH…85 KM/H  PRESENT MOVEMENT…WNW O.

LOCAL RADAR MIAMI  LOCAL RADAR TAMPA    As far as Sally’s future the upper air features a weak ridge to the north that is steering Sally on a west northwest course..

As it approaches Southeast Louisiana and the Central Gulf Coast the steering weakens and Sally slows down..

Global and short range models show a burst of strength just before landfall and this needs to be watched very closely..

Matters could be complicated further by heavy rains once on the coast due to the slow motion..

With Sally on the left in the Gulf of Mexico we have Paulette on the right which became a hurricane overnight..

Air Force Recon this morning found Paulette has strengthened with top winds now 80 mph and an eye has developed on satellite pictures..

8AM LOCATION…29.6N 61.4W  ABOUT 280 MI…390 KM SE OF BERMUDA  MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS…80 MPH…130 KM/H  PRESENT MOVEMENT…WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 14 MPH…22 KM/H  MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE…978 MB…28.88 INCHE.

Paulette is coming into Bermuda from the southeast which will afford the opportunity for Paulette to continue to strengthen as it passes the island..

When they come in from the southwest often times the upper air has stronger winds and some shear which causes storms to either peak out or even weaken a bit..

However the track from the southeast is over very warm water and lighter upper air wind conditions..

Paulette is forecast to turn northward after moving right over Bermuda and then turning northeastward out into the open waters of the Atlantic..

Paulette will interact with high pressure in New England to create rough surf on Tuesday in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic states..

Under Tropical Watches and Warnings ahead of Sally.

MOBILE, Ala. (WKRG)- We are under a TROPICAL STORM WARNING along the coast for our Florida communities..

A HURRICANE WATCH is issued for for Jackson County, Southern Mobile County, Southern Baldwin County and This means it is likely to see tropical storm force winds as Sally is anticipated to make landfa.

We are under a FLASH FLOOD WATCH as rain totals could get to over a foot for coastal areas..

This will be a rain maker as Sally is expected to slow down right before landfall..

The intensity forecast has Sally making landfall as a Category 2 hurricane..

The intensity forecast is still subject and likely to change..

We are also under a STORM SURGE WATCH of Baldwin and Mobile County and a STORM SURGE WARNING for Jackson County..

Since we will be situated on the east side of the storm we could see storm surge values up to 6 feet in Mississippi and around 2-4 feet possible in Alabama..

For today, there is a dry start with cloudy skies..

Rain chances are around 40% with afternoon thunderstorms possible..

Tomorrow we raise the rain chances to 70% as we can start seeing the impacts of Sally..

Tropical Storm Sally and our local impacts in the forecast.

Tropical Storm Sally: At this time, we all need to be prepared for any change when we have any tropical cyclone(storm-hurricane)approaching the region..

Short Term Forecast: Sally will intensify into a strong tropical storm and eventually make landfall off the Louisiana coast moving into the New Orleans area as a Category 1 Hurricane..

The landfall is early Tuesday morning, based on the latest forecast..

Local Impacts: Today through Tuesday the storm’s wind field at best keeps us at 10-20 mph winds potential gusts to 25..

Southwest Alabama will experience Monday into Tuesday winds up to 50mph..

The storm is very small and concentric, which means less dangerous impacts for our viewing area..

today there will still be an outer “type” band indirectly lifting into the region this late afternoon-evening and Monday..

Model disparity and perspective: The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has a more westerly track pulling the energy out of the region..

Our IBM GRAF models have it slowing down with the landfall around Mississippi-Alabama..

The reason for this set-up is from the cool front weakening it and stalling the system..

This cool front could keep it more concentrated south and almost stalling out Wednesday before it slowly lifts northward..

The repeated rainfall over the same areas will dump up to 5-6″, leading to low-level flooding just south of Bullock and Barbour counties or just outside the viewing area..

Locally we may not see much rain beside fast-moving brief heavy showers and embedded storms in the short-term forecast..

Currently, the NHC and GFS models pull the depression and post remnants out of Mississippi and Alabama..

This transition will lift plenty of energy across our east-central Alabama and west-central Georgia counties Thursday-Friday..

There are a lot of scenarios, so early speculation is not smart or a good forecast..

Stay tuned for the latest weather updates, with the most experienced weather team..

Sally Continues To Strengthen – NHC Forecasted To Be Hurricane at Landfall!.

Hurricane and tropical storm warnings are in effect for portions of the U.S. Gulf Coast today as Sally continues to churn for landfall later this week!.

Sally was gathering strength as it moved over the Gulf of Mexico, where water temperatures range from the low- to mid-80s F, and the storm is forecast to reach hurricane strength before making landfal.

Currently the system is producing rain and thunderstorms over western Florida at this time..

The storm brought flooding rainfall to parts of the Florida Keys on Saturday..

Some areas in the Keys picked up nearly a foot of rainfall..

By late morning on Sunday, the storm was centered 135 miles west of St. Petersburg, Florida, and about 280 miles east-southeast of the mouth of Mississippi River..

U.S. Gulf Coast Prepares for Second Hurricane in a Month.

HOUSTON, Sept 13 (Reuters) – Tropical Storm Sally strengthened off the west coast of Florida on Sunday and was poised to become a hurricane, bringing the threat of dangerous storm surges and high wind.

The storm track was disrupting oil production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for a second time in less than a month..

The Miami-based NHC said the storm was likely to reach hurricane strength on Monday, and approach the north-central Gulf Coast late on Monday and Tuesday..

Hurricane conditions were expected by early Tuesday from Grand Isle, Louisiana to Ocean Springs, Mississippi, including New Orleans, the center said..

As of 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) on Sunday, Sally was about 140 miles (230 km) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida, and heading west-northwest with top sustained winds of 60 miles per hour (95 kph)..

Sally carried the danger of storm surges – when the ocean rises at the coast over normal tide levels – of up to 11 feet (3.35 m), and rainfall of up to 12 inches (30 cm), the center said..

Oil companies evacuated staff from some offshore platforms on Saturday as Sally reached warm Gulf of Mexico waters..

Chevron Corp and Murphy Oil Corp evacuated offshore production platforms, and Chevron was preparing to halt output at two, spokespeople said..

Chevron said its Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery was following storm preparedness procedures..

Offshore oil producers Hess, BP, BHP and Occidental Petroleum said they were monitoring the storm and prepared to take actions..

Laura halted up to 1.5 million barrels per day of output and a half dozen refineries, two of which are still in the process of making repairs..

Grand Isle, Louisiana went from voluntary to mandatory evacuation on Sunday..

Further off in the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Paulette was moving closer to Bermuda, and was expected to move near or over the island on Monday morning, the NHC said..

Paulette was carrying top sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph) and was expected to strengthen during Sunday..

UPDATE: Here's the latest track and intensity forecast for Tropical Storm Sally as of 10 pm Sunday...looking much better for Acadiana at this time with main impacts well east of the area and minimal t.

Thinking has not really changed a whole lot as Sally is still expected to be a hurricane as it approaches the SE LA coast sometime early on Tuesday morning..

The storm is then anticipated to slowly move inland through mid-week producing heavy rainfall amounts in the process..

As we have been saying all along, the worst of the impacts and heaviest of rainfall totals will remain well off to the east of the Acadiana region..

However, our eastern parishes still remain at risk for the potential to see tropical storm conditions as tropical storm WARNINGS remain in effect for St. Mary, Iberia, Vermilion, and lower St. Martin .

Keep in mind though that if the track shifts even a little to the east, impacts would significantly go down for these areas of Acadiana as well..

Bottom line is that the highest threats from this storm will stay east of where the center of circulation makes landfall, and at this time, ALL of Acadiana remains west of that center line..

The forecast for the next several days highly depends on the track of Tropical Storm Sally, but if the track holds, we would likely see days filled with sunshine and relatively lower rain chances!.

We will of course continue to closely monitor, but nothing to be overly concerned about at this time..

Coastal authorities advise voluntary evacuation as Sally approaches.

Tropical Storm Sally forms in Gulf of Mexico with landfall forecast in Louisiana Wednesday as hurricane.

Placeholder while article actions load  Tropical Storm Sally formed on Saturday near the west coast of southern Florida..

The storm is set to bring heavy rain, strong winds and a potential storm surge flooding threat to portions of the Gulf Coast..

The system churned across the southern Florida Peninsula late overnight Friday into Saturday but was expected to move over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico beginning Saturday afternoon..

Intensification was expected to ensue soon thereafter, and it is now forecast to make landfall at hurricane strength as it draws nearer to shore, most likely in coastal Louisiana on Wednesday..

Louisiana prepared for Hurricane Sally on Sept. 13 after the storm left historic rainfall along the Gulf Coast one day prior..

(Video: Matthew Cappucci/The Washington Post)  A Storm Surge Watch is in effect from the Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Alabama/Florida Border, including Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas, Lake.

“Life threatening storm surge is possible along the Gulf Coast beginning on Monday,” the Hurricane Center stated..

Advertisement  A Hurricane Watch is in effect from Grand Isle Louisiana to the Alabama/Florida border, including Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and metropolitan New Orleans..

Assuming the storm reaches hurricane status, as is forecast, such conditions could begin moving ashore as soon as early Tuesday, the Hurricane Center said..

A Tropical Storm watch issued earlier on Saturday was extended westward from the Okaloosa/Walton County Line in Florida to the Alabama/Florida Border..

Tropical Storm Sally is the 19th named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season and the earliest S storm on record..

An average season winds up with close to 11 named storms..

But 2020 has already recorded the earliest-observed C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P and R storms..

The vast majority have been short-lived and weak, other than Hurricane Laura, which slammed Louisiana as a Category 4 storm in late August..

Residents of Lake Charles, La., described what it was like as Hurricane Laura tore through their city on Aug. 27, and vowed to rebuild..

(Video: The Washington Post)  After Sally, only three names are available on the 2020 Atlantic naming list before we are forced to dip into the Greek alphabet..

And with another tropical depression, a storm and three areas to watch in the Atlantic, it looks like activity won’t slow anytime soon..

Tropical Storm Sally to churn toward northern Gulf  At 5 p.m. Saturday, the low-level center of Tropical Storm Sally was located 30 miles southwest of Naples over the Gulf of Mexico..

The National Hurricane Center stated it had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph..

The National Hurricane Center noted the depression “was close to tropical storm strength when it moved ashore in Miami-Dade county” with strong wind gusts, but “there were no surface observations of ….

Winds must be sustained at tropical storm force for a system to be named, and that threshold was reached early this afternoon, according to the Hurricane Center..

A flood watch is in effect for much of the southern and central Florida Peninsula, where a broad 2 to 4 inches of rainfall was likely, with higher amounts over the Florida Keys..

Advertisement  The National Hurricane Center is calling for the system to become a high-end tropical storm in the eastern Gulf by early Monday..

Bands of heavy rain could overspread the Florida Panhandle, coastal Louisiana and southern Mississippi by late Monday or Tuesday, as the system churns west-northwest..

There is also a chance that the track may be shifted farther westward, with Sally exhibiting a more westward component to its motion..

What to expect  Heavy rain, strong wind gusts, coastal flooding and a few tornadoes are all possible as Tropical Storm Sally hits land next week..

The National Hurricane Center is predicting Sally to make landfall at hurricane strength, with peak winds around 80 mph..

The National Hurricane Center may issue storm surge watches for a portion of the Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida coastline on Saturday night..

Storm-surge flooding, which refers to the rise in water above normally dry land due to tropical storms and hurricanes making landfall, is a significant threat in the region this storm is expected to h.

Advertisement  Data suggests that, like many recent storms, Tropical Storm Sally may intensify right up until the point of landfall..

That means a few more, or fewer, hours over the Gulf could spell big differences in impacts..

As it stands now, wind gusts between 65 and 80 mph appear likely, primarily to the immediate east of where the center moves ashore..

That’s the same area where southerly winds could push ashore a storm surge of several feet..

That portion of the Gulf Coast is especially susceptible to storm surge flooding due to the shape of the coastline and other factors..

The exact magnitude of the surge threat remains to be seen, as it will depend on the storm’s track, intensity and exact timing..

The National Hurricane Center is calling for “total rainfall accumulations of 2 to 4 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches” across central portions of the Gulf Coast from late Sunday throug.

Advertisement  However, computer modeling data suggests this forecast may need to be raised significantly, with a broad 5-to-10 inches likely and localized amounts exceeding 20 inches probable..

The Hurricane Center cautioned against this possibility in its key messages, stating: “This is expected to be a slow-moving system that will likely continue to produce heavy rainfall and considerable .

Flash, urban and rapid onset flooding along small streams and minor to isolated moderate flooding on rivers is likely.”.

Paulette and Rene  Tropical Storm Paulette and Depression Rene were twirling over the open Atlantic on Saturday..

Both systems formed last weekend and have thus far largely remained away from land..

Advertisement  Rene had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph Saturday morning, down from 40 mph earlier in the day when it was a tropical storm..

It has been struggling to produce any long-lived shower and thunderstorm activity..

On Friday, a few hours passed with only a naked circulation, devoid of any thunderstorms or mentionable rainfall..

Renewed thunderstorms bubbled up later, keeping the storm alive..

Tropical Storm Paulette, on the other hand, is in a position to affect Bermuda as a hurricane..

It was on the cusp of becoming a hurricane Saturday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph..

The National Hurricane Center forecasts it to achieve Category 2 intensity with winds near 100 mph as it passes close to Bermuda on Monday, with impacts beginning Sunday..

A tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch are up for the island..

Additional areas to watch  As if three named storms simultaneously weren’t enough to keep track of, there are more tropical systems the Hurricane Center is watching..

A strong tropical wave a few hundred miles southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands in the tropical East Atlantic is likely to develop into a tropical depression or named storm in the coming days..

The Hurricane Center pegs it with a 90 percent likelihood of doing so..

Initially bullish on the system’s long-term prospects, weather models have now backed off some and are more tepid in their simulations..

Meanwhile, another tropical wave soon to emerge offshore of western Africa has a 50 percent chance of development..

Tropical Storm Sally develops, now expected to become hurricane, heads to Gulf Coast - Magnolia State Live.

Tropical Storm Sally formed Saturday off south Florida, becoming the earliest 18th-named storm on record in an Atlantic hurricane season as it headed toward the Gulf of Mexico amid signs of strengthen.

Sally emerged from a tropical depression swirling off the tip of Florida, on a forecast track bound for the Gulf..

It was expected to become a hurricane by late Monday that could threaten a wide swath of the northern Gulf coast early in the week..

It becomes the earliest 18th named storm in a busy tropical season, beating Stan, which formed on Oct. 2, 2006..

The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Sally would dump heavy rain around the Florida Keys and the southern and western parts of the state..

Maximum sustained winds were clocked at 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts..

Additional strengthening is expected over the coming days..

An Air Force Hurricane Hunter plane was scheduled to investigate the system later Saturday afternoon..

“Since the system will be traversing very warm waters and through a moist air mass with moderate vertical shear for the next few days, steady strengthening is anticipated,” forecasters wrote in their .

Sally was located 35 miles (60 kilometers) south-southeast of Naples on Saturday afternoon, according to National Hurricane Center said..

The system was moving to the west at 7 mph (11 kph)..

A tropical storm watch is in effect from the Ochlockonee River to the Okaloosa/Walton County Line..

The storm is currently expected to bring 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of rain to parts of Florida, with isolated totals up to 6 inches (15 centimeters)..

Meteorologists warn of an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and dangerous hurricane-force winds from southeastern Louisiana to the Alabama coast..

Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Paulette had maximum sustained winds at 70 mph (110 kph) and was 510 miles (820 kilometers) southeast of Bermuda, where a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning are in ef.

Forecasters said Paulette would become a hurricane later Saturday and drop up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain on the territory through Monday, adding that it is expected to be a “dangerous hurric.

Tropical Storm Rene weakened in recent hours and was reclassified as a tropical depression..

It had maximum sustained winds at 35 mph (55 kph) and was 1,225 miles (2,020 kilometers) east-northeast of the Northern Leeward Islands..

Forecasters said Rene wasn’t expected to strengthen and did not pose any threat to land..

Sally expected to strengthen over the Gulf of Mexico and Paulette becomes a Hurricane.

SARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) -  Tropical Storm Sally has sustained winds of 40 mph with higher wind gusts and the forward speed is starting to decrease as it moves west-northwest at 8 mph..

The storm is starting to slowly move away from Florida and into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, but we will continue to see squalls across the Suncoast through Sunday..

As we get onto the eastern side of the storm there will be a risk for isolated tornadoes..

Soils are saturated from heavy rain over the last couple of days, and with multiple rounds of tropical downpours there becomes a threat for minor flooding to take place especially for low lying areas .

Models are in good agreement that parts of the Suncoast could receive another 2-4 inches of rainfall through Sunday night..

Sally (WWSB)  Life threatening storm surge is possible along the Gulf Coast beginning on Monday, and a Storm Surge Watch is in effect for areas outside the southeast Louisiana Hurricane and Storm Dama.

Hurricane conditions are possible by early Tuesday from Grand Isle, Louisiana to the Alabama/Florida border, including Metropolitan New Orleans, with tropical storm conditions possible by Monday..

Tropical storm conditions are possible early next week in portions of the Florida Panhandle, where a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect..

Wind gusts to tropical storm force could occur over portions of the lower Florida Keys overnight..

Hurricane Paulette - Paulette now has maximum sustained winds of 75 mph with higher wind gusts..

The storm is expected to approach Bermuda as a hurricane on Sunday and will be near the island Sunday night and Monday..

A prolonged period of strong winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall is expected on Bermuda beginning Sunday evening, and a hurricane warning is in effect for the island..

Swells produced by Paulette are affecting portions of the Leeward Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States..

These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions..

Hurricane Paulette (WWSB)  Tropical Depression Rene - Rene is likely to gradually spin down due to persistent moderate shear and a fairly dry environment..

The hostile conditions are not likely to change too much, so Rene is forecast to lose all convection in a day or two and become a remnant low..

Sustained winds are 30 mph and it is currently moving northwest at 13 mph..

TD Rene (WWSB)  Tropical Depression Twenty - The depression is poorly organized at this time..

Maximum sustained winds of 35 mph and is moving west-northwest at 10 mph..

The storm is forecast to become Tropical Storm Teddy on Sunday or early Monday morning..

This storm will likely strengthen into a hurricane as it lifts northwest over the central Atlantic..

Disturbance 1 - A surface trough over the north-central Gulf of Mexico is producing limited shower activity..

While some slow development of this system is possible, strong upper-level winds related to Tropical Storm Sally will probably limit the chances of tropical cyclone formation..

The disturbance is forecast to move westward and then southwestward over the northern and western Gulf of Mexico through the next few days..

Disturbance 2 - Showers and thunderstorms located near and west of the Cabo Verde Islands are associated with a broad area of low pressure..

Environmental conditions support some additional development, and a tropical depression could form over the far eastern tropical Atlantic during the next two or three days while the system moves slowl.

By mid-week, upper-level winds should become less conducive for development..

First, Tropical Storm Paulette is expected to hit Bermuda as a hurricane by Sunday, prompting the Bermuda Weather Service to issue a Hurricane Warning for Bermuda as of Saturday morning..

8 p.m. forecast of Tropical Storm Paulette for Saturday, Sept. 12, 2020..

(National Hurricane Center)  The storm is headed for Bermuda, and its center will make its closest approach to the island on Sunday night and into Monday, possibly with 100 mph winds..

Advertisement  As of 8 p.m. Saturday, Paulette was 415 miles southeast of Bermuda, moving at 15 mph with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph..

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles from its center..

“Winds are expected to first reach tropical storm strength by late Sunday, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous,” NHC forecaster Robbie Berg said..

“Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.”.

Paulette is producing swells generating life-threatening rip current and surf conditions, which are expected to affect areas including the southeast U.S. this weekend, the NHC said..

East of Paulette, Tropical Storm Rene weakened into Tropical Depression Rene and continues to move northwest with maximum sustained winds at 35 mph..

As of 5 p.m., Rene was about 1,200 miles east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands, moving at 14 mph..

Based on NHC reports, a slower northwestward motion is expected by Sunday from Rene, with a slow westward motion by Sunday night..

5 p.m. forecast graphic of Tropical Depression Rene for Saturday, Sept. 12, 2020..

(National Hurricane Center)  Three other systems in the Atlantic show chances of development, including Tropical Depression 20 which formed on Saturday evening..

Advertisement  In the 5 p.m. update, Tropical Depression 20 formed over the central tropical Atlantic located about 2,030 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 35 .

“Slow strengthening is expected over the next day or so, and the depression is forecast to become a tropical storm by Sunday night,” NHC forecaster Andrew Latto said..

Second, a trough of low pressure located over the north-central Gulf of Mexico is showing slow development while moving west through the Gulf over the weekend..

It has a 20% chance of becoming a tropical depression or storm in the next two days and a 30% chance of doing so in the next five..

Finally, a large area of disturbed weather, which is associated with a tropical wave, is beginning to move off the west coast of Africa..

The surrounding environment is favorable for development over the next few days and a tropical depression could form in the eastern Atlantic..

Upper-level winds however will be less friendly toward this development on Tuesday..

Conditions call for the system having a 30% chance of developing in two days, and a 60% chance within five..

Of the systems in the tropics, it’s the last two waves off Africa that have the attention of FOX-35 meteorologist Jayme King..

Historically, some of the biggest storms, such as 2019′s Category 5 Hurricane Dorian, began as waves off Africa’s coast and then moved west with plenty of time to stew in the warm Atlantic waters, Kin.

“You can see clouds dispersing off of Africa; it’s a telltale sign the tropics are breathing right now,” King said..

“All areas in the Atlantic are conducive for development with the exception of some dry air..

The real hurricane season doesn’t start until August, September and October..

The big behemoth storms develop over Africa, around this time, becoming big hurricanes and moving west..

Advertisement  The remaining names for the 2020 season after the letter are Teddy, Vicky and Wilfred..

Whichever system develops first will either be designated as Tropical Depression 20 or Tropical Storm Teddy, depending on how far along it may be in its development..

NOAA forecast this year an estimated 19 to 25 named storms was possible before the end of season — it was the largest forecast NOAA ever predicted..

If the total amount of 2020 storms exceeds the designated name list — which it is expected to —hurricane specialists will begin using letters from the Greek alphabet to name storm; a tactic meteorolog.

A Sneaky Tropical Storm Or Hurricane Threat In The Gulf Of Mexico - What You Need To Know.

Updated 11:11 am on September 20th to reflect 11 am advisory information and the increasing threat of a hurricane..

This weekend marks the “peak” of the Atlantic hurricane season, and if you look at the latest National Hurricane Center tropical weather outlook, nature is right on schedule..

At the time of writing Saturday morning, I count six areas systems including two Tropical Storms (Paulette and Rene), Tropical Depression Nineteen, and three areas of interest..

Tropical Depression Nineteen is the one that I want to focus on because it is a sneaky little threat for Florida and the Gulf Coast states..

American GFS model forecast for what could be Tropical Storm Sally near the Louisiana coast by ... [+] Monday afternoon..

NOAA and Tropical Tidbits website  Our meteorological models have been sniffing out the possibility in recent days that Tropical Depression Nineteen could be a problem for Florida and the Gulf Coast s.

Brian McNoldy, a hurricane expert at the University of Miami, writes an excellent blog that I highly recommend for everyone..

On September 10th he wrote, “Aside from Tropical Storms Paulette and Rene in the central Atlantic, there are two weak waves in the western Atlantic — one approaching the Bahamas and heading west, and .

While he wasn’t bullish on them becoming tropical cyclones, he also noted, “but it's not out of the question either.”.

By September 11th, some of our regional models had become extremely bullish on the system approaching Florida..

IBM/The Weather Company tropical weather expert Michael Ventrice tweeted, “12Z HWRF is trying to spin up Invest #96L into a strong Tropical Storm/low grade Hurricane as it pushes over the warm Northea.

The American GFS and European model now have similar trends for the storm to likely become “Sally.”.

Simulated satellite image of what could be Tropical Storm Marco by Sunday morning..

NOAA and Tropical Tidbits website  What’s the current status of the storm?.

To answer that question, I consult the National Hurricane Center..

As of 8 am on the morning of September 12th, the storm was exiting the Florida panhandle and had sustained winds of 35 mph, which is just below the 39 mph threshold designated for tropical storms..

The storm was moving westward at 9 mph but will eventually take more of a northwestward track with a possible landfall somewhere near New Orleans, Louisiana..

(Note: At the 11 am update, the National Hurricane Center now expects the storm to be a hurricane just before landfall)  11 am advisory on what is expected to become Tropical Storm and Hurricane Sally.

Scattered flash flooding is also possible across portions of the central Gulf Coast Sunday through Tuesday morning..

Tropical storm conditions possible by Sunday evening in the Florida Panhandle (a Tropical Storm Watch has already been issued.).

Strong tropical storm or even a minimal hurricane by the beginning of the week with impacts (storm surge, rainfall, winds, tornadoes) from the Florida Panhandle to southeastern Louisiana..

The sea surface temperatures and wind shear in the Gulf of Mexico region CIMSS Tropical Webpage  There is plenty of warm water in the Gulf of Mexico, but forecast models anticipate that some wind shea.

The ultimate intensity of the storm will depend on the delicate dance between “ample fuel supply (warm water)” and wind shear..

If Sally does form, we will be down to three names left on the 2020 season list with much it still ahead of us..

Hurricane Sally weakens slightly; rainfall in Central Georgia still likely.

There is still a good bit of uncertainty when it comes to how much rain we will see and the timing of this system..

Example video title will go here for this video  As of the Tuesday 11 a.m. update from the National Hurricane Center, the storm maintains its status as a category 1 hurricane..

The outermost rain bands of Sally will bring a chance for localized flooding and maybe a few brief, spin up tornadoes as we head into Wednesday night through Thursday..

Models are still not in agreement on timing, so we still could be dealing with tropical downpours into Friday..

Rainfall totals over two inches through the weekend are looking more likely, but we could see numbers go much higher than that..

Central Georgia may also face an isolated tornado threat this week..

WHAT THE STORM IS DOING NOW: Sally is now a category one hurricane as of this morning with sustained winds of 85 mph..

The central pressure did drop a touch since the last update, but Sally is not forecast to restrengthen to a category 2 storm before landfall..

OFFICIAL NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER FORECAST: The system made a turn to the northwest as of the 11 am advisory, and will make the turn to the northeast by the overnight hours Thursday..

While there is still a good bit of uncertainty in where the exact center of circulation will track, the northeastward motion will bring much of the southeast heavy rainfall..

Due to the uncertainty with the models, we could see the most rainfall, wind, and isolated tornado threat from Sally any time from Wednesday to Friday..

The system will be slow to move out, but should finally exit the region by Friday or Saturday, then a cold front will be the culprit for our breezy conditions to end the week and start the weekend..

POTENTIAL CENTRAL GEORGIA IMPACTS: The two main impacts that central Georgia may see from this system are heavy rain and the potential for isolated tornadoes..

Forecasted rainfall totals vary depending on which model you choose..

For instance, the RPM model shows a lot of rain for us coming through Wednesday..

When you look at the EURO model, most of the rain goes to north Georgia, and not until around Friday..

Severe weather chances cannot be completely ruled out, especially during the Wednesday - Friday time frame..

Isolated tornadoes are possible with any land falling tropical system..

As the remnant low passes near or over central Georgia, there could be enough wind shear to support a few isolated tornadoes..

The red and white arrows on the map below indicate the different speed and direction of wind at different layers in the atmosphere..

This twisting and turning is what leads to the isolated tornado risk with land falling tropical systems..

We'll evaluate this threat carefully as we go through the week..

Significant wind gusts are not likely as the remnant low passes by..

We could see gusts in the 20-30MPH range this week starting Wednesday, with isolated gusts as high as 40mph..

We'll look at the first six names on that list:  The peak of hurricane season is upon us and the tropics are as active as ever.Sept..

11 was one of the most active points in the annual hurricane season..

This year's hurricane season is on pace to be the most active of all time, so it's no wonder that the tropics remain very busy..

The National Hurricane Center now says seven tropical waves have formed in the Atlantic storm basin.Tropical Depression 19 has formed into Tropical Storm Sally early Saturday afternoon..

As of 8 p.m., Sally is traveling west-northwest at 8 mph with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph.The system is expected to strengthen to a hurricane by late Monday and potentially bring "life-threateni.

Paulette is moving west-northwest at 14 mph.Paulette is expected to approach the Bermuda beginning Sunday evening..

A hurricane warning is currently in effect for the island.After hitting Bermuda, the storm is expected to turn north and stay away from the United States..

Tropical Storm Delta forms, heads into the Gulf late Tuesday.

Impacts could include rain, coastal flooding and wind, but there is still uncertainty in the long range track..

Example video title will go here for this video  NEW ORLEANS — Tropical Storm Delta  On Monday morning, Tropical Storm Delta formed..

The forecast path has it entering the Gulf of Mexico Tuesday night or Wednesday as a hurricane..

Impacts including rain, wind and coastal flooding look likely for parts of the Gulf Coast on Thursday and Friday - but there is still uncertainty in exact impacts and locations since the system is far.

The National Hurricane Center's average error for the location of a system five days out is 200 miles, so the longer-range part of the forecast could easily shift east or west..

Right now the center line crosses over southeast Louisiana and shifted slightly westward since the depression formed Sunday night, but model solutions range from far east Texas to the Florida Panhandl.

While there is uncertainty in the eventual path and intensity of the system, the current National Hurricane Center forecast has it reaching hurricane strength on Tuesday and perhaps strengthening to a.

Eventually, cooler waters near the Gulf Coast plus increasing wind shear should cap its strengthening potential..

Right now any impacts for south Louisiana would likely happen Thursday and Friday - but again, it's difficult to say how intense any impacts will be this far out..

Rainfall of 2-5+ inches, along with coastal flooding and strong winds look likely in that timeframe if the system takes the current forecast path..

It's too soon to say specifics about local impacts from soon-to-be Tropical Storm Delta, but rain at least looks likely Thursday and Friday..

An early look at totals shows about 2-5 inches possible..

@WWLTV #beon4 pic.twitter.com/G7zvhnHyEE — Alexandra Cranford WWL-TV (@alexandracranfo) October 5, 2020  Steering factors for the storm include high pressure over the western Atlantic which will start.

Its eventual turn to the north and northeast will be due to a trough of low pressure and surface front that will settle over the region late in the week..

When the system encounters the trough and surface front, it should pull to the northeast..

The path may go a little more west if Tropical Storm Gamma stays somewhat strong and exerts a pulling influence over soon-to-be Delta..

A more westward track would likely bring more intense impacts to south Louisiana since it would place us on the wetter east side of the center..

A lot depends on the timing of the trough, along with the strength of Tropical Storm Gamma, plus a few other factors, plus the exact position of the storm when it reaches the Gulf..

Until we see these things take shape, we'll have some uncertainty..

GAMMA  Tropical Storm Gamma's winds are weaker early Monday morning at 50 mph as dry air gets wrapped into the slowly moving system..

The center was in the southern Gulf, and it is expected to drift to the west and south generally over the next few days as a ridge of high pressure builds ahead of the system..

Gamma should hang in the southern Gulf through late week and eventually weaken..

It will not directly affect Louisiana, but its presence may exert some influence on Delta once that system enters the Gulf midweek..

A weaker Gamma could be a good thing for south Louisiana since it would exert less of a westward pull and could allow soon-to-be Delta to stay farther east of us..

There is still much uncertainty in how much influence Gamma will have..

Hurricane Sally makes landfall as a Category 2 | Here's how it will impact the DMV.

Heavy rains and a large storm surge are problems for parts of the Gulf Coast..

This season is already the second busiest tropical season on record..

Example video title will go here for this video  WASHINGTON — Sally was upgraded and regained strength to a Category 2 hurricane Tuesday night and made landfall around 6 a.m. (5 a.m. CDT) Wednesday mo.

The storm is a slow mover and that means it is dropping tons of rainfall, which is expected to cause widespread flooding..

Overnight Tuesday the storm was packing 105 mph winds and moving north-northeast at only 2 mph..

The remnants of Sally could bring a showers and even some rain, mostly south of D.C., on Thursday afternoon into early Friday morning..

The models are trending bringing rain from Sally farther north..

In the south, heavy rains of 6 to 20 inches fell along the coasts of Alabama, Mississippi and far western Florida, with an isolated 30 inches of rain in a few locations..

MOBILE, Ala. (WKRG) – Tropical Storm Sally is the eighteenth named storm of the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season..

Sally is showing signs of strengthening  A west-northwest track will continue Sunday..

The storm is expected to strengthen and reach hurricane status Monday..

Landfall is likely along the Louisiana or Mississippi coast..

It’s proximity to our coast will greatly determine the impacts..

Most of the models are in agreeance with a landfall along the Louisiana Coast..

ALERTS: A Hurricane Watch is in place for Jackson, southern Mobile, and southern Baldwin counties..

A tropical storm warning has been issued for Jackson county (MS), southern Mobile, southern Baldwin, and coastal NW FL..

A Flash Flood Watch has been issued for Jackson, George, Greene counties in MS, Mobile, Washington, Baldwin, Clarke, Escambia counties in AL, and our NW FL counties until Thursday morning..

RAINFALL: Sally will likely be a slow-moving tropical cyclone..

This means rounds of heavy, tropical downpours for Lower Alabama, Mississippi, and Northwest Florida..

Right now, the highest rainfall totals will likely fall along and south of the I-10 corridor..

Some areas may pick up 10-15″ of rain through the end of next week..

The amounts will run lower the farther inland you head..

WINDS: Tropical storm force winds are likely to occur, especially slower to the coast..

The chances are also in the moderate range inland..

The hurricane-force wind potential is very low, mainly at the coast..

SURGE: The highest surge potential will likely occur over Coastal Louisiana and Mississippi..

Coastal Alabama is forecast to receive 2-4′ mainly during high tide cycles..

Possible hazards from Sally Monday through Wednesday  It is important to stay updated through the weekend..

The forecast track will continue to change with new updated from the National Hurricane Center..

Sally downgraded to Tropical Storm, life-threatening flooding continues over Panhandle.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WTXL) — Sally has been downgraded to a tropical storm but it does not change the impacts that are ongoing..

Heavy rainfall and localized flooding is still our greatest local threat through Tuesday, along with the rest of the Panhandle to our west..

Sally is still dragging tons of moisture and rain into the Big Bend and Southern Georgia..

NHC says Sally is expected to deliver life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and flash flooding to parts of the northern Gulf Coast..

WATCHES AND WARNINGS:  Storm Surge Warning: * Port Fourchon Louisiana to the Okaloosa/Walton County Line Florida* Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and Lake Borgne* Mobile Bay  Tropical Storm Warning.

Tropical Storm Sally forms, to head toward LA as hurricane.

The National Hurricane Center says Tropical Storm Sally has formed as the system moves off of Florida into the Gulf of Mexico..

It is forecast to head for the Gulf Coast somewhere from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle..

"Tropical storm or hurricane watches... could be issued for a portion of that area later today.".

Sally is expected to get stronger as it moves through the Gulf..

"Additional strengthening is expected over the next couple of days, and Sally is forecast to become a hurricane by late Monday.".

Landfall is currently forecast for near the Louisiana / Mississippi state line Tuesday..

"Sally is expected to produce through Tuesday rainfall of 3 to 6 inches with localized amounts of 8 inches along the Gulf Coast from the Florida Peninsula to southeast Louisiana.".

Sally weakens to a category 1 hurricane and moving a little faster; heavy rain continues along the Gulf Coast.

After making landfall over Gulf Shores, Alabama this morning as a category 2 hurricane with winds of 105 mph, Sally has weakened to a category 1 hurricane with winds of 80 mph..

Sally is moving a little faster to the north-northeast at 5 mph..

Sally will continue to weaken this afternoon and tonight..

It will likely become a tropical storms late tonight or Thursday as it continues a northeasterly track..

With the expected slower movement of the hurricane, very heavy rain and severe flooding is likely as Sally slowly moves inland..

Hurricane forecast models suggest some areas may receive over 20 inches of rain along the Gulf Coast..

The current forecast track takes the remnant low through Georgia, Northern South Carolina, and now possibly through the North Carolina Sandhills by Thursday and Friday..

This new forecast track is farther north into North Carolina..

This may bring an increased chance of heavy tropical rain to our area through Friday evening..

The speed and track at which the remnant low moves will determine when rain moves into the Piedmont, when it moves out, and how much rain we get..

Some forecast models indicate we could get several inches soaking rain..

Tropical Storm Sally forms, expected to affect Mississippi Gulf Coast - Home - WCBI TV.

Tropical Storm Sally forms, expected to affect Mississippi Gulf Coast  COLUMBUS, Miss. (WCBI) – Tropical Storm Sally has formed near the Florida Keys, making it the 18th named storm in what is shaping.

As of 2pm Saturday, the storm has sustained winds of 40 mph as it continues moving westward into the Gulf of Mexico..

There, the storm is likely to strengthen and eventually become a category 1 hurricane..

Landfall is expected along the southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, or Alabama coasts late Monday night or early Tuesday..

Regardless of where the storm makes landfall, residents between Morgan City, Louisiana and Pensacola, Florida can expect flooding rain, storm surge, and gusty winds..

There is a potential for the storm to strengthen even more than currently forecast, so we’ll need to continue to monitor..

Locally, a cold front will help to keep the worst of Sally to our south and east..

Still, periods of rain and wind will be possible on Wednesday and Thursday..

Tropical Storm Sally Forms Headed To Central Gulf Coast Tuesday.

Tropical Storm Sally Forms Headed To Central Gulf Coast Tuesday  Tropical Storm Sally has formed from Tropical Depression 19 as the center emerges off the coast of Southwest Florida..

Surface reports show gusts to gale force along the Florida east cast and satellite and radar images show that the system continues to organize..

Once the circulation completely clears the Florida coast steady strengthening will get underway and Sally will likely become a hurricane..

Conditions aloft are favorable and Gulf of Mexico water temperatures are in the mid to upper 80s..

Winds along the east coast of Florida particularly in Southeast Florida are all southeast or south-southeast while the Florida Keys all have southwest winds and the bouy out in the open Gulf Waters ha.

Sally is located 35 miles south southeast of Naples so technically the center is still partially over land but barely..

SATELLITE  REGIONAL RADAR  Bands of showers cover the Florida Peninsula with the core rain from Sally over Southern Florida..

The counter clockwise circulation is obvious on the radar with quite a bit of rain falling in South Florida..

2PM LOCATION…25.6N 81.6W  ABOUT 35 MI…60 KM SSE OF NAPLES FLORIDA  MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS…40 MPH…65 KM/H  PRESENT MOVEMENT…W OR 270 DEGREES AT 7 MPH…11 KM/H  MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE…1004 MB…29.65 IN.

Louisiana may be in line for this again but this time it will be Southeast Louisiana vs the Southwest..

This could put also the Mississippi and Alabama Gulf coast at risk as well..

Virtually all the intensity models take this to at least a category 1 hurricane and 1 so far takes it to a category 3..

Hurricane model forecasts have gotten wider on possible tracks given the weak flow across the Northern Gulf of Mexico..

The range of possible tracks increases the uncertainty here with the National Hurricane Center forecast basically splitting the difference and take the middle of the road forecast..

MANY THANKS TO TROPICAL TIDBITS  Please note that with regards to any severe weather, tropical storms, or hurricanes, should a storm be threatening, please consult your local National Weather Service .

10:00 a.m. update: Hurricane warnings have been expanded west now to include Morgan City..

Tropical Storm Warning now issued from Intracoastal City to Morgan City..

The National Hurricane Center says that Sally is moving west-northwestward at about 10 kt..

The tropical storm should continue on that general heading and speed over the next 12 to 24 hours as it steered around the southern flank of a mid-level ridge..

After 24 hours, Sally is expected to be near the western portion of the ridge which should cause the storm to slow down and turn northwestward..

Sally is expected to have winds at maximum 90 mph at landfall..

--------------------  Tropical Storm Sally formed in the eastern Gulf of Mexico early Saturday afternoon with winds of 40 mph..

The storm is expected to reach hurricane strength as it nears the northern Gulf coast sometime late in the day on Monday..

As of now, the forecast track calls for Sally to make landfall somewhere along the SE LA/Mississippi coastlines..

This is not a set in stone forecast as the cone of uncertainty remains somewhat large beyond the Monday time frame..

This is due to the fact that upper-level steering currents are expected to break down and become weak for early this week which could potentially lead to the storm stalling out for a couple of days an.

Obviously with a slow moving storm, the main concern would be heavy rainfall in the days ahead, especially for those on the eastern side of where the storm makes landfall..

At this time, the worst of the impacts and heaviest of the rainfall totals is still expected to be well east of the Acadiana region..

However, we do not have to go too far to see really impressive and life threatening estimated rainfall totals..

Here's a look at two of our most reliable models and their respective estimates on precipitation through the next week..

Euro is the most aggressive, but it paints the picture that some areas along Gulf Coast could easily pick up over a foot of rainfall..

Again, it appears these higher amounts will stay off to our east, but that does not mean we should let our guards down by any means..

Hurricane WATCHES are now in effect for parts of the South Louisiana and Mississippi coastlines..

These do NOT include areas in Acadiana at this time..

I hear the phrase "Well it's just a category storm" often, but you have to remember that every storm is different from the other (We could potentially even see the storm get a bit stronger than that u.

In this case we are expecting a slow moving storm which means surge and flooding will be a major concern for those in SE LA and other parts of the northern Gulf Coast..

So for those following us in those areas, I can not stress enough how important it is to take the storm seriously and to be prepared..

Hurricane Watch from Southeast Louisiana through Alabama.

Tropical Storm Sally is forecast to become a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico and make landfall somewhere from Southeast Louisiana to the Alabama-Florida line Tuesday..

The current forecast track from the National Hurricane Center calls for landfall as a category one hurricane with 85 mile per hour winds in lower Plaquemines Parish before a second landfall near Gulfp.

"A Hurricane Watch is in effect from Grand Isle Louisiana to the Alabama/Florida border, including Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and metropolitan New Orleans," the Hurricane Center said..

A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area..

A watch is typically issued 48 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds..

"On the forecast track, the center is forecast to move over the southeastern and eastern Gulf of Mexico tonight and Sunday, and then move over the north-central Gulf of Mexico Sunday night and Monday..

As of 4:00pm maximum sustained winds were near 40 mph with higher gusts..

"Strengthening is expected over the next couple of days, and Sally is forecast to become a hurricane on Monday.".

Sally could bring flooding rains from Louisiana through Florida..

The storm could also cause wind damage across the region; damaging structures, trees and power lines or poles..

Storm surge outside of levee protection will also be an issue..

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND----------------------  RAINFALL:  Sally is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches across the Florida Panhandle, and 6 to 12 inches with isolated amounts of 18 in.

TROPICAL UPDATE 5:30 pm: Tropical Storm Sally could threaten Louisiana by Tuesday.

LAFAYETTE, La. (KLFY) – Satellite shows storms across Louisiana and here’s a look at Tropical Storm Sally..

Here’s the latest from the national hurricane center on Sally..

A tropical storm warning remains in effect for Vermilion, Lower St. Martin, Iberia, and St. Mary–a hurricane warning in effect east of Grand Isle, Louisiana..

Forecast for tonight–storms ending–partly cloudy late..

Forecast for Monday, a few storms possible northeasterly breeze..

The Weather Service has issued hurricane and storm surge warnings  for parts of the northern Gulf Coast as Tropical Storm Sally strengthens off  the west coast of Florida..

Tropical Storm Sally strengthened again Sunday morning and now has maximum  sustained wind speeds of 50 mph..

The National Hurricane Center says the storm  should strengthen to a hurricane on Monday..

As of 5 a.m., Sally is about 115 miles west of Port Charlotte, Florida and  moving west-northwest at about 13 mph..

The tropical storm is forecast to  continue moving in that direction until it slows down and makes a turn toward  the north-northwest on Tuesday..

The NHC says Sally will move over the Gulf of  Mexico Sunday and Monday before approaching the north-central Gulf Coast late  Monday or Tuesday..

A tropical storm warning is in effect for Vermilion, Iberia, St. Mary, and St. Martin Parishes..

This area could see wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph late Monday and Tuesday..

Expect scattered power outages, toppled trees, and some roof damage in these areas..

Rainfall projections are 1-3 inches for south central Louisiana..

Minor coastal flooding is expected during high tides on Monday..

Be aware that the trees left standing after Hurricane Laura are quite vulnerable..

Wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph could blow down some of these trees and/or damage tarps on our roofs..

Storm Surge Warning in effect for:  Port Fourchon, Louisiana to the Mississippi/Alabama  Border  Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas and Lake Borgne  Hurricane Warning in effect for:  Grand Isle, Louisi.

Tropical storm wind probabilities increase as you go further eastward into southeastern Louisiana..

Effects across acadiana will be minimal from this system if it stays on the current track..

Latest european model shows the possibility of 10-20 inches of rainfall for southeastern louisiana, mississippi, and alabama..

We currently have five entities we are watching in the tropics..

Forecast for tonight–rain ending–partly cloudy late..

Forecast for tomorrow–scattered storms likely–highs in the upper 80s to lower 90s..

Seven day forecast shows a wet pattern continuing through the next seven days..

Heavy rain will be the biggest threat from this system, but a surge and wind threat could now be in the mix as well..

Yesterday, models had a much weaker system and much more dry air across the Gulf..

Now the system is initialized stronger in the model fields, so it’s able to wall off the dry air and wrap up into a stronger system before landfall on Tuesday..

The National Hurricane Center is calling for a category one hurricane to make landfall across southeastern Louisiana/coastal Mississippi on Tuesday..

This forecast seems reasonable, although a category two cannot be ruled out..

Wind shear could increase slightly once it approaches the northern Gulf coast, which could limit the strengthening process..

A HURRICANE WATCH has been issued across southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama–from Grand Isle, Louisiana to the Alabama/Florida border..

Tropical storm force wind probabilities appear to be around 20-40% for Acadiana, based off the latest track from the NHC..

If this current track holds, effects from this system should be minimal across Acadiana, most likely limited to a few squally thunderstorms with embedded wind gusts..

The majority of the flooding rains will be near and east of where the center makes landfall..

Model projections show the possibility of 10-20 inches of rainfall in these areas, which would be a substantial flooding event..

We’ll have to continue to watch for subtle changes in track as parts of eastern Acadiana are still in the cone of uncertainty..

As it stands now, I feel confident Acadiana will see little impacts from Sally and the chance of a drastic track change is small..

GULF DISTURBANCE: A disturbance just south of the Louisiana coastline is increasing our storm chances today and tomorrow..

This disturbance has a “low” chance for development as it generally works west and later southwest across the western Gulf of Mexico..

Models do not currently show much from this system as it gets pushed southward into the Bay of Campeche early next week..

TROPICAL DEPRESSION #12 has formed across the eastern Atlantic..

Models are bullish with this system and make this a hurricane through the next few days..

Good news is that this system should stay an Atlantic system and not threaten the United States..

Tropical Storm Sally has formed off south Florida, becoming the earliest 18th-named tropical storm on record in a busy Atlantic hurricane season  ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Tropical Storm Sally forme.

In the National Hurricane Center’s 5 p.m. forecast, meteorologists said a hurricane watch is in effect for metropolitan New Orleans..

The watch extends from Grand Isle Louisiana to the Alabama-Florida line, including Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas in Louisiana and greater New Orleans..

Forecasters said a life-threatening storm surge is possible along parts of the Gulf Coast beginning Monday..

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm, and officials in New Orleans issued a mandatory evacuation order for areas outside of levee protection, including Vene.

Sally emerged from a tropical depression swirling off south Florida, headed Saturday into warm Gulf waters..

On Saturday afternoon, gusty winds and heavy rain swept through South Florida due to Sally..

The National Hurricane Center said Sally would dump heavy rain around the Florida Keys and the southern and western parts of the state..

An Air Force Hurricane Hunter plane was scheduled to investigate the system late Saturday..

“Since the system will be traversing very warm waters and through a moist air mass with moderate vertical shear for the next few days, steady strengthening is anticipated,” forecasters wrote in an ear.

Sally was located 30 miles (45 kilometers) south-southeast of Naples on Saturday afternoon, according to the hurricane center..

A tropical storm watch has been extended westward from the Okaloosa/Walton County Line to the Alabama/Florida Border..

A Storm Surge Watch is in effect from the mouth of the Mississippi River to the Alabama/Florida Border, including Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas, Lake Borgne in Louisiana — and Mobile Bay, Alabama..

The storm is expected to bring 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of rain to parts of Florida, with isolated totals up to 6 inches (15 centimeters)..

But, reflecting the breakneck pace of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, forecasters are already turning their attention to two more threatening tropical weather systems: Hurricane Teddy and a distur.

(Video: Tanner Moss/The Washington Post)  In a special bulletin, the National Weather Service wrote that central South Carolina, in particular, was experiencing heavy rainfall, at rates of one to two .

“The expected intensity and duration of this rainfall will cause flash flooding, particularly across central SC where the highest amounts are expected through [4 p.m. Thursday],” it wrote..

“Some of it could [be] significant on any sensitive or urban locations.”.

East of where the center tracks, some tornadoes were possible..

A tornado watch was in effect until 6 p.m. in central and eastern South Carolina..

Hurricane Teddy gains ‘major’ status  On Thursday morning, Hurricane Teddy intensified into a major Category 3 hurricane, with peak sustained winds of 120 mph..

Positioned 1,155 miles southeast of Bermuda, it was sweeping northwestward at 12 mph..

The storm is forecast to intensify further, attaining winds of 130 mph by Thursday night, which would make it a Category 4 storm..

Advertisement  By the weekend and early next week, Teddy is predicted to encounter cooler waters and an increase in hostile high-altitude winds, which would cause it to weaken slightly..

Nevertheless, by Monday, when it will be making its closest pass to Bermuda, it is still expected to be a Category 2 hurricane with winds over 100 mph..

“While the exact details of Teddy’s track and intensity near the island are not yet known, the risk of strong winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall on Bermuda is increasing,” the Hurricane Center wro.

Teddy could be the second hurricane to strike Bermuda in the same week..

This past Monday, Hurricane Paulette passed directly over the island..

After Teddy passes Bermuda, some models suggest high pressure over the North Atlantic could force it to make a rare, hard left turn toward Maine or the Canadian Maritimes, while others suggest it will.

System forming in the Gulf of Mexico  The Hurricane Center wrote Thursday morning that an area of disturbed weather over the southwest Gulf of Mexico is becoming better organized..

Beyond that, computer models project it will continue north and northeastward and may approach the northern Gulf Coast on Wednesday and Thursday..

It is too soon to predict specifically what land areas this potential storm could brush or strike directly, or its intensity..

But, because of its slow movement, it may pose yet another heavy rainfall threat for portions of the western and northern Gulf Coast..

After Sally: Rescue, recovery and swelling rivers - Alabama Now.

PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — Rivers swollen by Hurricane Sally’s rains threatened more misery for parts of the Florida Panhandle and south Alabama on Thursday, as the storm’s remnants continued to dump heav.

Coastal residents, meanwhile, looked to begin the recovery from a storm that turned streets into rivers, ripped roofs off buildings, knocked out power to hundreds of thousands and killed at least one .

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned residents and visitors in flooded areas that they would need to remain vigilant as water from the hurricane subsides, because heavy rains to the north were expected to.

“So this is kind of the initial salvo, but there is going to be more that you’re going to have to contend with,” DeSantis said..

Orange Beach, Alabama, Mayor Tony Kennon told The Associated Press one person in the popular vacation spot died and another was missing as a result of the storm..

Sally blew ashore near Gulf Shores, Alabama, on Wednesday morning as a major hurricane with 105 mph (165 kph) winds..

It moved slowly, exacerbating the heavy rains’ effects..

More than 2 feet (61 centimeters) fell near Naval Air Station Pensacola, and nearly 3 feet (1 meter) of water covered streets in downtown Pensacola, the National Weather Service reported..

Some Pensacola streets looked like rivers with whitecaps at times..

A replica of Christopher Columbus’ ship the Nina was missing from where it was docked at the Pensacola waterfront, police said..

The ship was later seen run aground in downtown Pensacola, Pensacola News Journal reported..

The storm was a nerve-racking experience for University of West Florida student Brooke Shelter..

She was wide awake Wednesday morning as strong winds and rainfall battered her home, marking her first experience with a hurricane..

“The damage around my home is pretty minor, for which I am thankful for,” Shelter said..

“However, it is so sad seeing how flooded downtown is.”.

Sally weakened to a tropical depression late Wednesday and picked up speed..

The National Hurricane Center said its center would move Thursday out of southeast Alabama and across central Georgia, reaching South Carolina on Thursday night..

On Thursday, the storm was dumping heavy rains over central and northern Georgia and western South Carolina..

The National Weather Service said up to a 1 foot (30 centimeters) of rain could accumulate in parts of Georgia, where multiple flash food warnings were issued Thursday..

Forecasters said South Carolina could see isolated totals of 10 inches (25 centimeters)..

Flooding was also possible in portions of North Carolina and Virginia through Friday..

There was also a chance of tornadoes Thursday in southern Georgia and northern Florida..

More than 500,000 homes and businesses were without electricity Thursday morning in Florida, Alabama and Georgia..

News outlets reported some trees were toppled in Georgia..

In Clayton County, fire officials warned residents to avoid areas where power lines had fallen..

In Orange Beach, Kennon said the damage was worse than that from Hurricane Ivan, which hit 16 years to the day earlier..

In a Facebook briefing, Kennon said distribution points would be established Thursday for water, ice and tarps..

“It was an unbelievably freaky right turn of a storm that none of us ever expected,” Kennon said of Sally, which once appeared to have New Orleans in its sights..

At least eight waterways in south Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were expected to hit major flood stage by Thursday..

Included in the warnings were the Styx and Fish rivers, Murder Creek and Big Escambia Creek..

In Florida, major crests were expected on the Perdido, Blackwater, Shoal and Yellow rivers, forecasters said..

Brewton, Alabama, a city of about 5,200, can expect moderate to major flooding, said meteorologist Steve Miller of the National Weather Service office in Mobile..

Silverhill, a town of about 1,200, was threatened by the Fish River, which had crested, and Seminole, an Alabama village on the Florida state line, by the still rising Styx River, Miller said..

As a hurricane, Sally tore loose a barge-mounted construction crane, which then smashed into the new Three Mile Bridge over Pensacola Bay, causing a section of the year-old span to collapse, authoriti.

Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center was tracking two other Atlantic storms..

Hurricane Teddy strengthened to a Category 2 hurricane early Thursday with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 kph) and was forecast to become a major hurricane by Friday as it moves northwestward.

Tropical Storm Vicky was expected to dissipate in the coming days..

Tri-state Helping Hands response arriving this weekend after Hurricane Sally deluges U.S. Gulf Coast.

It was an anniversary no one on the east end of the U.S. Gulf Coast wanted to celebrate or relive..

But 16 years to the day when Hurricane Ivan began battering that region in 2004, Hurricane Sally made landfall at roughly the same spot on Sept. 16..

That latest iteration of severe weather across the U.S. Southeast prompted plenty of Ivan memories that local Latter-day Saints and their neighbors were likely hoping to forget..

Still, they “welcomed” Sally with trademark resilience..

“We have trees that have fallen, some flooding and power outages … but overall, we’re doing pretty good,” Pensacola Florida Stake President Kevin Curtis told the Church News the morning after Sally’s .

Flood waters move on the street, Wednesday, Sept. 16, 2020, in Pensacola, Fla..

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Credit: AP  No missionaries or members were injured during the storm and no Church-owned properties suffered significant damage..

Still, the homes and properties of more than 100 Latter-day Saint families were damaged, most significantly in Pensacola and the neighboring communities of Gulf Breeze and Navarre, reported Elder Doug.

In the first weekend following the hurricane (Sept. 19-20), a small-scale Church-sponsored Helping Hands volunteer effort focused on cleaning up the homes and properties of Church members..

“We were able to take care of about 90 percent of our affected members last weekend,” said Elder Carter..

Fortunately, he added, most of the significant damage from Sally was limited to fallen trees and branches — so few Latter-day Saint families have been flooded out of their homes or otherwise displaced.

“There’s not as much muck-out work as we originally thought there might be,” he said..

This weekend’s (Sept. 26-27) Helping Hands relief effort will be far larger in reach and numbers..

“We’re looking to bring in about 3,000 Helping Hands volunteers from 35 stakes from Florida, Alabama and Georgia,” said Elder Carter..

The crews will focus their efforts on approximately 3,000 work orders from across affected Gulf Coast communities in Florida and Alabama..

“There are a lot of people hurting down here,” Elder Carter said..

Helping Hands teams are expected to begin arriving at command centers in Florida and Alabama on Friday, Sept. 25..

Check-in times are being staggered to adhere to social distancing practices..

About two-thirds of the volunteers are expected to camp on the grounds of local stake centers and other Church-owned properties, where portable toilets and temporary showers are being installed..

Traditionally during large-scale Helping Hands projects, volunteers gather as one early on Sunday morning for a brief sacrament meeting before heading out to work..

But for the upcoming Hurricane Sally relief effort, participating wards will meet in smaller congregations because of COVID-19 concerns  Sally was the fourth hurricane to make landfall in the United S.

The hurricane was downgraded into a tropical storm after reaching landfall, then further weakened into a tropical depression by day’s end..

Still, the slow-moving storm will be long remembered as a destructive rain-producer..

“We had 30 inches of rain in Pensacola — 30-plus inches of rain — which is four months of rain in four hours,” Ginny Cranor, chief of the Pensacola Fire Department, told CNN..

A man watches floodwaters, Wednesday, Sept. 16, 2020, in downtown Pensacola, Fla..

“Power is being restored quickly and fuel is [widely] available in the area,” Elder Carter said on Wednesday, Sept. 23..

Sixteen years ago, Hurricane Ivan destroyed or severely damaged scores of Latter-day Saint homes in Jamaica, Grenada and other neighboring islands before continuing north to the U.S. Gulf Coast..

There is one key difference between the two hurricanes..

Ivan was fast-moving, with a landfall speed of about 13 mph..

But Sally seemed in no hurry, moving at 2 mph — a pace easily matched by most walking humans..

PERDIDO KEY — In five years aboard the Tropical Hideaway Too, Jerry Ash has ridden out some bad storms before, but Hurricane Sally was different..

Anchored at the Perdido Key RV Resort and Marina, Ash and his compatriots in their similarly tied up sailboats, hunkered down for the night before the winds picked up..

None of them were expecting it to get as bad as it did Wednesday..

“I’ve been through some bad ones before, but I know better,” Ash said about riding through a hurricane on the boat..

Ash was alerted to the man by onlookers, trying to figure out how to help him..

The trapped man had been on a boat anchored at the neighboring marina on the other side of the bridge when it broke loose and capsized, Ash would come to learn..

The man’s only option was to cling to the underside of the bridge, all night as the hurricane passed with Category 2 force winds and relentless rain..

He was out there all night in just shorts,” Ash said..

Unsure how to help, Ash initially posted a grainy picture of the man to Facebook, asking anyone to pass along a message to rescuers..

Eventually, rescuers did come with Jet Skis, but the winds were too much, Ash said, so he resolved to do it himself..

Story continues below photo gallery  “I knew if I could get to my boat, I could get to him,” he said..

“So I came out here, grabbed my kayak and about 500 feet of rope and went out.”.

Ash paddled out to get the man the rope, then several onshore helped pull him in..

The man had a dislocated shoulder and was understandably shaken up..

“But man, I bet he’s got a story to tell,” Ash said..

“My boat was just swinging from one side to the other,” he said..

“I put Ace’s life vest on, put mine on and grabbed my ditch bag..

When I jumped off the side of the boat I was just hoping the boards of the dock would be under my feet.”.

Alt made it, white-knuckling the handhold on Ace’s life vest, to a small community center in the middle of the RV park..

He, Ash and others watched out the window as their boats waved from one side to the other, up and down..

Alt realized that some of the boats, and the way they were tied, wouldn’t make it..

He and Ash ran up and down the dock adjusting the boats..

“If we didn’t, it would be like a domino effect,” he said..

“I mean I didn’t want anyone to lose their boat, they’re our homes, but if one got loose it could just start that domino.”.

“I’m a bit of an adventurist, a thrill-seeker, but at that point there was no more thrill in it,” he said..

Emile Petro’s Oyster Bar Restaurant and Marina, on the other side of the bridge from the RV park, didn’t fare as well..

Boats were everywhere they could be except upright in the water..

“If you own a business on the water, you expect it to happen from time to time,” he said surveying the damage..

“If we’d known it would have been this bad, we would have had the boats moved.”.

Mel Knapp, an entertainer who lives on the bottom floor of a condo unit at the marina, rode out the storm there..

“Well it just started as rain and wind, you know, wasn’t anything to be concerned about,” he said..

Knapp and his dog, Smokey, moved upstairs to a neighbor’s unit, worried the water would soon be pouring into his home..

“I watched as these boats tumbled over each other,” he said..

“There was a guy in one boat here, and another tied up over there, and then there was the guy stuck under the bridge.”.

Story continues below photo gallery  Once the weather calmed down, Knapp went downstairs to check on his home..

Expecting the worst, he was pleasantly surprised everything was intact..

He even found his bicycle that had been on his patio, a little dirty, but still in working order..

Further inland, where a small community of homes sat, residents were still fairly shocked by Sally’s strength..

Michael Choron, his wife, Denise, and their 12-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son were throwing damaged items to the curb on Gongora Drive..

Choron, who owns All Jack’d Up charters, will have to salvage two boat lifts behind the home he built in 2017..

“At one point I thought ‘I hope I tightened that damn nut right when I built this thing,’” he said..

“I did get kind of scared when I saw those lifts collapsing.”.

Denise Choron said if they’d known the storm was going to get as bad as it did, her family would have evacuated..

“It was kind of downplayed,” she said, stopping to take a deep breath..

“I get kind of emotional thinking about what could have happened..

Hurricane Sally made landfall as a Category 2 storm near the city of Gulf Shores, Alabama, at 4:45 a.m. local time on Wednesday..

The storm then drifted northeast, dumping more than 2 feet of rain in areas between Mobile, Alabama, and the Florida panhandle..

"We had 30 inches of rain in Pensacola — 30-plus inches of rain — which is four months of rain in four hours," Ginny Cranor, chief of the Pensacola, Florida, Fire Department, told CNN on Wednesday..

Parts of downtown Pensacola were completely submerged amid "historic and catastrophic flooding," according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC)..

Tropical Tidbits  Climate change makes hurricanes more frequent and devastating than they would otherwise be, since storms feed on warm water..

Higher water temperatures also lead to sea-level rise, which in turn increases the risk of flooding during high tides and in the event of storm surges..

What's more, warmer air holds more atmospheric water vapor, which enables tropical storms to strengthen and unleash more precipitation..

"Our confidence continues to grow that storms have become stronger, and it is linked to climate change, and they will continue to get stronger as the world continues to warm," James Kossin, an atmosph.

A warming planet also makes storms like Sally move more slowly, allowing them more time to lash an area with wind and dump more rain..

Climate scientist Michael Mann tweeted Wednesday that Sally was "moving slower than a turtle in peanut butter.".

Over the past 70 years or so, the speed of hurricanes and tropical storms has slowed about 10% on average, according to a 2018 study..

Over land in the North Atlantic and Western North Pacific specifically, storms are moving 20% to 30% more slowly..

(Updated) Cullman, Hanceville officers head south to assist after Hurricane Sally.

CULLMAN, Ala. – In response to a mutual aid request to Division F of the Alabama Mutual Aid System (AMAS), the Cullman Police Department and Hanceville Police Department sent officers to Foley, Alabam.

The officers pulled out from Hanceville City Hall on a mission of mercy to the storm-ravaged region of south Alabama..

They will be providing security at a feeding location and equipment staging point in Foley for contractors working on cleanup and recovery operations..

Hanceville Mayor Kenneth Nail and Public Works Director Rusty Fields accompanied the group to deliver a pull-behind camper to be used as a mobile command center..

The officials will return Friday, but the police officers will work on the coast for up to seven days..

According to Nail, another team of officers could be sent after that..

AMAS is a program administered by the Alabama Emergency Management Agency to ensure that trained first responders can be placed throughout the state as needed in response to a major disaster..

The Cullman County Sheriff’s Office is on standby to send follow-up assistance when needed..

The four officers from the Cullman Police Department who have been deployed are Lt. Scott Sanford, Officer Jake Lambert, Officer Tyler Jackson and Officer Jeff Mize..

The two officers from Hanceville are Lt. Brannon Hammick and Sgt. Josh Howell..

“We’ve been on deployments with the sheriff’s department and Hanceville and Division F officers, so we’re familiar with it,” said Cullman Police Chief Kenny Culpepper..

“We’re glad to participate because at some point we may need it..

Also, for example, when the tornadoes came through in 2011, 70% of our officers had been on deployments like this on previous hurricanes or tornadoes, so they were used to, and had experience working .

That experience is invaluable, the real-world experience you get from something like this that you can use if you ever have a similar situation.”.

Cullman Fire Chief Brian Bradberry said Cullman Fire Rescue is also part of AMAS Division F..

The department has not yet been called upon to assist but stands ready to assist if needed..

Lt. Scott Sanford told The Tribune, “We’ve been associated with Region F for many years, which is one of seven regions in the state of Alabama that respond to emergency situations through EMA, typical.

Usually, it’s disaster relief, whether it be hurricanes, tornadoes, anything of that nature, if another agency needs help..

Apparently, the folks down south have reached out to us and requested some help, and we’re going to send six officers from Cullman County, total- four from Cullman city and two from the city of Hancev.

On Wednesday, the Cullman Power Board sent a crew to Fairhope to assist with power restoration for customers served by Fairhope Public Utilities under a statewide mutual aid agreement administered by .

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the people affected by the hurricane and with our local law enforcement officers, first responders, utility workers and other personnel who are answering the call fo.

Said Nail, “We’re always real ready and able to assist our neighbors in need..

Folks came and helped us in 2011, and we just think it’s our responsibility to do that.”.

The Cullman Electric Cooperative also sent crews to assist..

The Co-op said on Facebook: “Early this morning, Cullman Electric Cooperative sent nine men to help Covington Electric Cooperative and Baldwin EMC..

They will work to restore power in the aftermath of Hurricane Sally..

We are thankful for their willingness to serve, and our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by Hurricane Sally.”.

Shop owners in St. Andrews dealing with affects from Hurricane Sally.

ST. ANDREWS, Fla. (WJHG/WECP) - Beck Avenue in St. Andrews was completely flooded Wednesday morning, some cars driving through the flood waters and some deciding to turn around..

Gypsybeach Treasured Kreations owner Kathie Patterson said she was just glad she was able to make it to her shop despite many closed roads..

“I turned around and did about four other things to get here today, so it’s been a real struggle to get here, but I’m all high and dry in here so I’m good,” said Patterson..

Patterson was surprised by the amount of flooding the area was experiencing..

It’s pretty deep today, so the flooding is pretty bad in several locations,” said Patterson..

Airbnb host for properties in St. Andrews Jan Johnson was alarmed by what she was seeing throughout St. Andrews..

“I drove all the way from St. Andrew’s Marina to the Downtown Marina, and the flooded streets had all of the water coming up through the sewer, through the man hole covers and all that so that was ala.

I was like okay, our infrastructure can’t handle that much water at a time, so that was bad,” said Johnson..

Johnson said Hurricane Michael taught her a lesson about storms in this area..

“I checked on my property this morning actually to see how high the water was because it’s just right over here and from Hurricane Michael I know the elevation of all my properties, so I made sure of .

Patterson and Johnson both agreed they were thankful the damage to St. Andrews or the shops wasn’t worse..

Bolstering Calls for Climate Action, 'Mutant Sloth' Hurricane Sally Leaves Major Mess for Gulf Coast.

Flooding from Hurricane Sally is rooted in human action and racist history.

Placeholder while article actions load  As Hurricane Sally moved inland from the Gulf Coast, “historic and catastrophic flooding” unfolded..

Recent months have brought fires to the West, derechos to the Midwest and hurricanes to the U.S. coasts — a scale of disasters we aren’t equipped to manage well all at once..

The deluges, tempests and conflagrations are not simply acts of gods or nature..

They are consequences of humanity’s actions, including climate change, whose harms fall most heavily on the most vulnerable..

The exploitation of our environment has long been a source of human misery that has particularly affected marginalized groups..

Rivers played a key role in the spread of plantation slavery, providing fertile soil and a major route to market for both cotton and enslaved human beings..

Yet the rapid spread of plantation slavery and the cultivation of cotton led to extensive erosion that made many rivers more flood-prone, endangering people and disrupting people’s lives and livelihoo.

Then and now, the exploitation of people and place went hand in hand..

Advertisement  By the time of the Civil War, the Lower Mississippi River had become the center of plantation slavery in the United States..

Maps show high concentrations of enslaved people living along the river..

This river, as well as many other smaller rivers like the Trinity River in East Texas and the Arkansas River in Arkansas, connected planters to global markets..

The South’s steamboat trade took off in the 1830s with about half the nation’s cotton bales being shipped on rivers during the last two decades of slavery..

These boats included slave traders who bought and sold human beings while traveling along the region’s rivers..

Rivers also were central to agricultural production, as the sediment left behind from seasonal flooding created the rich soil for nutrient-hungry cotton plants..

Properties along the waterfront were the first to be claimed by the wealthiest and largest enslavers..

Rivers, therefore, fueled slavery and concentrated enslavers’ wealth..

Rivers were also sites of hope or fear for enslaved people..

An enslaved family might be torn apart and “sold down the river,” whereas another might use the same stream to become reunited or escape to freedom..

On the bustling Mississippi River, people escaped to freedom because of the relative anonymity it provided and the network of free African American steamboat workers who aided them..

Smaller rivers offered less anonymity, but the closer connections among enslaved residents still made the river a potential route to freedom..

Advertisement  These environmental dynamics of exploitation and opportunity continued after the Civil War..

On the Trinity River, flooding — due in part to erosion from cotton production — often thwarted Freedmen’s Bureau agents from reaching many of the plantations to enforce laws that limited the mistreat.

Furthermore, these early floods had a devastating effect on families planting their first crops after the end of slavery..

Receiving no freedom dues at all — much less 40 acres and a mule — most freed people had little choice but to “work on the halves” for former enslavers..

The Trinity River then destroyed much of their labor, flooding year after year and wiping out their crops, making their very survival all the more tenuous..

The floods left them with nothing to pay for their medical care or other needs..

Advertisement  In the summer of 1868, a doctor serving the freed people near the Trinity sought help from the Freedmen’s Bureau to support his practice since the crop failures of the previous two year.

Another freedman wrote the bureau headquarters in Galveston, Tex., with a request for help navigating the environmental challenges the river posed..

“We are in a starving condition,” he wrote, “our crops have failed in every particular, first the high water, next the worms, next the rains, we did our duty, we tried our best, we are now reduced, as.

At the same time, however, the river played an important role in the quest for African American independence..

Rivers helped some freed people to rebuild their families..

On Texas’ Trinity River, one woman who had been separated from her family downstream during the Civil War reunited with her mother on a steamboat shortly after Gen. Gordon Granger’s Juneteenth proclam.

As the steamboat trade abruptly disappeared after the construction of major railroads, the land along the Trinity became less valuable for market farming, making it possible for freed people to squat .

Away from the plantations, they could grow fewer cash crops and focus more on subsistence from fishing and hunting, which made flooding less damaging..

Furthermore, the dense and often muddy bottomlands provided a moat of protection from some of the racist violence that defined the Jim Crow South..

These flood-prone lands ironically offered a sense of security from the inhumanity, despite the sometimes deadly whims of the waters..

Advertisement  That rivers were at the heart of the tension between freedom and slavery within American life has prompted some of the most enduring works of literature..

Mark Twain’s “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” (1884) takes place on the Mississippi River, which defines the possibility of freedom even as it also represents its dangers..

While Langston Hughes’s “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” (1921) encompasses rivers across the world, he was inspired passing the Mississippi River and thinking about its connections to slavery and the fig.

The theologian Howard Thurman argued (1945) that America’s history of slavery explained the power behind many of the most famous spirituals such as “Deep River.”.

The metaphor of a river made the spiritual something with which all of its listeners could connect..

Thurman wrote, the “ever-changing stream has ever been the bearer of the longings and yearnings of mankind.”.

At the same time, this song described a real and recent history, “for these early singers — enslaved people as they were — quite practically the river may have been for many the last and most formidab.

Thurman understood how American rivers had emerged as tools for both exploitation and empowerment..

These tensions continue to shape the environment today..

Starting in the 1970s, many Southern rivers became centers of deadly industry, such as the Lower Mississippi River, known as cancer alley..

Instead of destroying cotton crops, floodwaters now carry toxins into the homes and bodies of poor river residents..

Pollution, dam building and now climate change has made Southern rivers life-taking rather than life-sustaining..

Today, as hurricanes cause rivers to flood dangerously in the South, these dynamics are exacerbated..

Tackling these issues — and those stemming from future climate crises — means we need to tap into the inspirational history of rivers as a source for positive change..

Environmental justice means finally breaking the hold that racism has long had in degrading our land and fully embracing the legacy of empowerment..

Black Pensacola neighborhood, unfortified against storms, took massive hit from Hurricane Sally.

Placeholder while article actions load  PENSACOLA, Fla. — Wendy Evil, 52, spent Thursday morning picking through her drenched belongings..

Her house, her yard, her . . . everything was flooded..

Choose your plan ArrowRight Evil holed up for Hurricane Sally in the one-story home she shares with her fiance, Kenneth Gibbes, and her three grandchildren, just west of downtown Pensacola..

The storm’s wobbly path made it difficult to assess how bad things might get here in the Wedgewood neighborhood, a low-lying area that has traditionally been home to African American families..

The fortified downtown area of Pensacola, which has received significant attention and hurricane-proofing in recent years, saw significant flooding this week, but its high waters receded quickly as th.

Wedgewood, on the other hand, is nearly defenseless against storm surge off the Gulf of Mexico, and its waters do not go away so quickly..

Advertisement  It also faces another challenge: It is surrounded by landfills and a giant sand pit, which have long caused residents to raise health concerns and also have served to channel water towa.

So as Sally made a hard right turn in the Gulf early this week, intensifying as it veered away from New Orleans and toward the Florida-Alabama border, residents knew what was likely to happen..

But they didn’t all have time to escape as it approached landfall not far from here..

“Once it said it was a direct hit, it was too late to evacuate,” Evil said..

“At about 2 a.m. Wednesday, my granddaughter was like: ‘Granny, look at the water.’ ”.

Flowing off and around an eight-foot-tall dirt berm protecting the sand pit behind her home, the water came fast..

Evil watched as it flowed over her carpets, appliances and everything else she owns..

It was the fourth time her home has flooded since she purchased it in 2007..

As the remnants of the hurricane moved northeast across Georgia and Virginia on Thursday, areas of Florida and Alabama assessed the damage, much of which was from storm surge along the coast and torre.

Advertisement  At peak surge, ocean water poured into the coastal Florida Panhandle, where heights reached 5.6 feet, the third-highest level on record in Pensacola, behind only Hurricane Ivan in 2004 .

Belleview, Fla., saw 30 inches of rain as Sally slowed to a crawl and hammered the coastline..

As of Thursday morning, more than 500,000 customers in Alabama and Florida were without power..

Evil and her family wandered their dark house, seeing what could be salvaged..

“You don’t know what’s healthy to keep and what’s not,” she said..

We’re going to have to go through everything to see what can be done.”.

The children’s beds were covered with clothes, toys and school supplies, an effort to keep things off the still-soaked carpets..

The air in the home reeked of mold, and tiles from the roof covered the backyard..

Evil felt certain she would have to shutter the day care she runs out of her house..

Advertisement  “We probably won’t have lights for another seven days,” Gibbes said as he tried unsuccessfully to hook up the family’s generator..

“When it dries, you best believe they’re going to come and push that dirt right back up,” Evil said, pointing to the mound..

“If it weren’t for that, this water wouldn’t even be here,” he said..

Evil renovated the home after it last flooded in 2017, but this week she said she is tired of the cycle: “I been telling him I want to move,” Evil said..

The situation is made more difficult because Evil cares for her three young grandchildren who are 13, 10 and 7..

They would eventually like more space for the large family, but not on this plot..

“I’d say we could add on, but we can’t stop that water,” Gibbes said..

The food they had left would spoil if Gibbes could not get the generator to work..

Because electricity remained out, Evil couldn’t assess the condition of her appliances..

But worse, the environment simply did not feel safe..

Advertisement  “My 10-year-old had open-heart surgery in June,” Evil said..

“So we can’t really have her inhale all these smells.”.

But it seemed the family really didn’t have much choice..

Unable to find a hotel, they planned on continuing to sleep in the home..

Down the street, signs tacked to trees advertised “Guaranteed white sand” for sale..

At a white gate marking the entrance to Wedgewood, a neighborhood watch sign sits next to one that is a bit more unusual: “Alert: hydrogen sulfide may be present.”.

That sign, hung by a local environmental activist, provides a phone number for the Escambia County Water Quality and Land Management Division..

Calvin Green, 50, said he grew up in the Wedgewood neighborhood..

When he was a child, he remembers hunting in the open woods where the sand pit would later be built..

“It used to be just a stream when they started building the sand pit,” he said..

Advertisement  Kurtina Gaines, 48, said she suspects the landfills and sand pit surrounding Wedgewood contribute to erosion and the constant flooding the neighborhood sees..

“We’ve been through a lot of things, fighting all that,” she said..

Robert Dukes, 66, was likewise concerned: “We’ve been having our share of floods.”.

Dukes said the holding pond meant to capture the neighborhood’s floodwaters often fails to do so..

On Thursday, local drains were submerged in deep, stagnant puddles..

Dukes’s son, Robert Dukes Jr., 40, thought neglect and even outright racism play a part in the neighborhood’s issues..

“That hole down there wasn’t dug deep enough,” he said..

Because this is what happens anywhere it’s a Black community..

Natasha Kelson, 46, sat on her Wedgewood porch to get a break from the stifling indoor heat..

“It was a lake out here yesterday,” she said, pointing to her yard..

Advertisement  Kelson is pregnant — due in three weeks — and she said she felt “miserable” with no air conditioning..

But aside from the heat, she was happy the home she shares with her husband, William Kelson, also 46, had been largely spared..

In the backyard, where the Kelsons just held their baby shower, the grass was strewn with leaves and branches, and a fence was slightly bent..

“I’m going to have to rake all this up,” William Kelson said, looking slightly distressed..

Hurricane Sally Hit Gulf Shores, Ala., With 25 Inches Of Rain.

Hurricane Sally Hit Gulf Shores, Ala., With 25 Inches Of Rain  DAVID GREENE, HOST:  I mean, this has just felt like a busier, more dramatic hurricane season..

He's a professor of geography and atmospheric sciences at the University of Georgia..

He also worked for NASA and was president of the American Meteorological Society..

GREENE: So Sally was over the Gulf of Mexico for days..

I mean, is that at all typical of a storm this size, or are we seeing something different here?.

SHEPHERD: Well, you know, I wrote in Forbes over the weekend - last weekend that this was going to happen, that we were going to have a slow-moving storm that would likely, irrespective of its categor.

There was a slight jog a bit to the east, but it was certainly within the hurricane error that we get with our models right now..

I think we have to educate the public that hurricanes aren't points or lines; they're areal..

GREENE: Well, I mean, this storm season in the Atlantic has seen 20 named storms so far..

That's the earliest we've seen this many storms at this point on record..

You know, we saw that we were going to have an active Atlantic hurricane center..

If you look at some of the early season forecasts, if you will, it was clear that we were going to have conditions conducive to hurricanes - warm sea surface temperatures, no El Nino..

In fact, we are shifting to a La Nina right now, what - which actually helps that even more..

But of course, there's also amazingly warm sea surface temperatures and ocean heat content..

And right now, they're running on 93 octane, not 87..

GREENE: So there are some experts who have said these bigger, slower, wetter storms and more storms is due to climate change..

I mean, is - do you see the link as that simple, or how do you see this?.

I served on the National Academy of Sciences panel in 2016 that looked at this problem of attribution - can we link weather to climate change?.

There's certainly some things that are more attributable to others..

Hurricanes sort of fell in the middle because we know there's certainly some impacts - the climate change on hurricanes..

I think what we're seeing - there's peer-reviewed literature that suggests that storms in the North American continent are slowing down in response to the atmospheric patterns that are due to climate .

And of course, we know sea surface temperatures are warm..

And most of the global warming is in the oceans anyhow, and that warming is coming back to the atmosphere through things like hurricanes..

But what concerns me the most - and I think people along coasts have to get used to this - these rapidly intensifying storms..

That's probably related to warmer ocean heat content due to climate change, but it is a bit more nuanced answer..

We don't blame every single storm on climate change..

But these storms are certainly indicative of what our future holds and even our immediate current situation, as well..

What is your message to people who live in some of these coastal communities that are at high-risk areas?.

I mean, I think a lot of people who have lived there for a long time feel like they know the drill..

My message is, get this - these words out of your vocabulary..

Yes, you may have, but the current and future generation of hurricanes is different, perhaps, than what you've lived through..

We also have to remove this notion of, oh, it's just a Category 1 or Category 2..

In fact, what we know is rain can be a significant factor irrespective of category..

Talking about this busy hurricane season with Marshall Shepherd..

We might have to come back to you again as this season goes on (laughter)..

Sally updates: Fatal I-20 crash, school closures, flooding and more.

AUGUSTA, Ga. (WRDW/WAGT) - A fatal wreck, flooded and debris-strewn roadways, and weather warnings are greeting CSRA residents as now-downgraded Hurricane Sally moves through the region..

And due to the flooding, the Richmond County School System is sending students home early and keeping campuses closed Friday..

Fatal crash on Interstate 20  A tow truck driver was killed this morning on Interstate 20 at Cobham Road in McDuffie County..

He was trying to load a vehicle and was struck by another vehicle that left the scene, authorities said..

Georgia State Patrol troopers were attempting to locate it..

The Georgia Department of Transportation reported that an eastbound lane of the interstate was closed for a time due to the accident..

School closures  The Richmond County School System announced that campuses were “experiencing a substantial impact from flooding.”.

As a result, the district planned to begin implementing an early release schedule at noon..

“There is already significant damage to many of our schools and it is best to make sure our students are not in schools that are unsafe,” the district said in a statement..

Schools will remain closed Friday for students and teachers..

Most of the heavy rain has passed to our east but a few showers remain as Post-Tropical Cyclone Sally continues to move to the northeast..

For the afternoon expect a few light showers and maybe a rumble of thunder..

Showers are still expected in the overnight but will be lighter and more scattered in nature..

The chance for a few additional showers will continue tomorrow morning as well..

Flash-flood watches are in effect for most of the CSRA through 8 a.m. Friday..

Autoplay Caption  Other developments  Widespread flooding of streets and yards was reported in areas that included Laney Walker Boulevard, Springwood Drive in the National Hills area, and the area of .

A school bus slid off South Old Belair Road in Columbia County in an incident that happened before 7:30 a.m. Contacted a few minutes after it occurred, dispatchers characterized it as a minor incident.

Witnesses said drainage ditches in the area of the curved roadway were full of water after a night of rain..

There were several reports of trees and branches falling into roadways and fender-bender crashes at several locations around Augusta and Aiken..

Georgia Power’s restoration efforts began overnight and continue today..

The utility said its personnel were responding to about 675 cases of damage, resulting in about 28,000 customers without power as of 11 a.m. Outages are spread across the entire state, and the utility.

The utility also said it was ready to respond with help after receiving requests from sister company Alabama Power..

Elsewhere  Moving at just 3 mph, or about as fast as a person can walk, the storm made landfall at 4:45 a.m. Wednesday close to Gulf Shores, Ala..

As Sally continues to move slowly, forecasters officials expect storm surges as high as 7 feet in parts of the Southeast..

Here’s a look at the situation:  Charleston, S.C.: People prepared for the storm by sandbagging in an attempt to protect their businesses and homes from rising waters..

Florida Panhandle: The region was battered by the storm, which was so strong in Pensacola, it knocked a barge loose that smashed into a bridge, knocking out part of it..

Then a construction crane mounted on the barge fell on the bridge..

At least 377 people were rescued from flooded areas..

Atlanta: As Sally moved through the area, a tree fell on top of two home, trapping three people, one of whom died..

Officials say one person was able to escape and another was rescued by firefighters..

Orange Beach, Ala.: The wind blew out the walls in one corner of a condominium building, exposing at least five floors..

Things to know  Before a storm: Know your risks of flooding or storm surge and tropical storm or hurricane-strength winds..

Check your emergency kit, unplug major appliances and charge cellphones in case you lose power..

Make sure you have insurance policy numbers stored in your phone..

If you’re planning to evacuate, assume you’re going to be away from your home longer than you expected..

During a storm: Take safe shelter inside a sturdy building away from windows and doors..

Avoid contact with conductors of electricity – appliances, metal objects and water..

After a storm: Never touch any downed or low-hanging wire, including telephone or TV wires that touch a power line..

Never pull tree limbs off of power lines yourself or enter areas with debris, downed trees or standing water as downed power lines may be buried in wreckage or submerged in water or mud..

Rescuers save people trapped in flooded homes along Blackwater River as waters rise.

Hundreds of people were still stuck in their flooded homes Thursday, the day after Hurricane Sally lashed the Florida Panhandle and sent local rivers into major flood stage..

Some people were hellbent on staying in their homes even as the floodwaters rose, while others were in desperate need of rescue..

Reid and Jodi Walker stood on the porch of their home on the Blackwater River in East Milton, waving down a water rescue team that was boating by on the street in front of their house..

The couple was stranded in their home on stilts as the floodwater rose, two of hundreds of people who needed rescue throughout Wednesday and Thursday after Hurricane Sally lashed the Florida Panhandle.

"We didn't mean to have to be rescued," Jodi said from the porch as she held her terrified dog, Jasper, by his leash..

"We tried to escape, but it (the storm) was too quick.".

The Walkers had called the East Milton Volunteer Fire earlier in the day and said they were trapped in rising floodwaters in their home on River Landing Drive, along the Blackwater River..

Volunteer rescuers from the Citizen Crisis Response Team responded and enlisted the help of Scotty McGuire, a local commercial fisherman who lives on Paradise Island, and his 17-foot Carolina Skiff to.

Navigating the boat through the water logged streets was hazardous..

McGuire got the bottom of his boat caught on more than a few mailboxes, and had to dodge the tops of trees that hung at face-height over the water..

McGuire's house in Annie's Basin was OK, but his fishing boats docked by the Fish House restaurant in Pensacola didn't fare so well..

Andy Longwell from Indiana and Keith Montague from South Carolina were the two CCRT volunteers who were on McGuire's boat to help rescue the Walkers..

After a few wrong turns due to submerged street signs, the team found Jodi and Reid Walker and their standard schnauzer, Jasper, waving from the porch of their River Basin home..

McGuire expertly navigated his boat to the Walkers' front porch, which was on stilts..

The couple grabbed their valuables, including medicines, important papers and a few days' worth of clothes, and were helped into the boat by the rescuers..

Jodi said they had experienced flooding by their Blackwater River home before, but never anything like this..

"We were prepared for a normal flood, like five or six feet," she said..

"The transformer went at noon (Wednesday) and and then we started having to use the generator..

The water usually goes down to where we could walk out, but this water did not go down..

"  Jodi said they only had about a six-foot clearance left in their house, and with the waters projected to continue rising, they decided it was best to leave..

For many Santa Rosa residents, the worst is yet to come  The worst of Hurricane Sally is yet to come for many residents in Santa Rosa County, as heavy rains to the north of the county in Alabama and G.

Brad Baker, the county's public safety director, urged people to get out before they got into trouble..

Evacuate now:Santa Rosa urges residents on rivers, creeks to evacuate immediately as floodwaters rise  “If you live in a riverine flood zone, we encourage you to evacuate before you get trapped in you.

“If you’re already trapped, call 911 and we will have our water rescue teams come evacuate you.”.

The Blackwater River is already at major flood stage, cresting at 25 feet at 10 a.m (flood stage is 11 feet) Thursday and expected to rise even further..

Coldwater Creek is at 22 feet (flood stage is 10 feet), and Pond Creek, which doesn't have an official flood gauge, is flooding as well..

As slow-moving Sally continues inching northward and dumping torrential rain on Georgia and Alabama over the next few days, the water is going to run south through thousands of rivers and creeks until.

Sally rips through:Hurricane Sally shocks Pensacola area with surprising strength, heavy wind and floods  The flooding is going to drag out the disaster for Santa Rosa County, which was already hit he.

“The amount of surge, the high winds and the very long-lasting hurricane that we just went through definitely is one of the worst ones I’ve seen in my tenure in Santa Rosa County,” said Brad Baker, a .

Volunteers from the Civilian Crisis Response Team, an Indiana-based nonprofit that sends trained volunteer rescue teams to areas affected by disaster, had a team in Milton performing water rescues all.

They had performed "too many to count" by Thursday morning, according to Andy Longwell, a volunteer from South Carolina..

"We believe that the more people that are trained out there and the more people that are in place to respond to accidents and floods and helping emergency responders, the better," Longwell said..

The volunteers are working with local fire departments and the local emergency management office to coordinate rescues and add manpower where first responders can't be..

While people like the Walkers were in need of help, other people, like Berna Hollingsworth who lives a few streets over, said they weren't going to leave..

When asked if she would try to get out, Hollingsworth shrugged her shoulders..

This is my home," she yelled over the hum of the generator on her porch..

Baker said it's important for as many people to leave as soon as they can, so as to save the lives of both the people in the homes and the first responders..

“If you stay, the danger is that the water rises faster than we can get our resources back to you,” Baker said..

“And that also increase the danger of injury to our resources that we’re sending you..

So if you want to evacuate, evacuate before you’re inundated with water.”.

Hurricane Sally in East Tennessee: Clear skies and cooler temperatures ahead this weekend.

You may need to pull out the fall sweaters a little early this year as Hurricane Sally's outer bands move out of East Tennessee, leaving cooler temperatures in her wake..

As rain dies down Friday evening, the National Weather Service in Morristown expects a cold front to move into the area..

"The air will be cooler and drier," said NWS meteorologist Jeremy Buckles..

"We'll see the sky start to clear up as we move through the weekend.".

Highs should top out in the mid-70s through much of the weekend..

Lows for Knox County are expected to stay in the low to mid 50s through Monday evening, dropping even into the 30s at higher elevations in the Great Smoky Mountains..

Sunday and Monday are likely to be the coldest days, with low temperatures forecasted at 51 and 50 degrees..

The predicted Knox County lows are the coldest the area has seen since May 14..

But, Buckles said, while the weather isn't what we're used to, it is within normal temperature ranges for this time of year..

‘Our city is underwater’: Even the Mayor of Gulf Shores did not take Hurricane Sally seriously.

Screenshot / Youtube  Hurricane Sally deluged the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama with catastrophic and life-threatening flooding as the storm, since downgraded to a tropical depression, crawle.

“It just unloaded,” Tim Booth, a semiretired truck driver in Loxley, an Alabama town off Mobile Bay, told The New York Times..

Sally dumped an estimated 30 inches of rain on Pensacola, Florida, that effectively submerged the city’s downtown and caused a section to break off of the brand new Three Mile Bridge..

The storm, made worse by climate change, is just the latest in a hurricane season so busy that officials are about to be forced to use the Greek alphabet to name storms..

In Mobile, Alabama, the storm destroyed massive oak trees in the city’s historic Mienville Square..

As of Thursday morning, the storm was responsible for at least one death and had knocked out power for more than 500,000 people..

Forecasters expect it to continue through central Georgia and South Carolina..

The latest research indicates hurricanes are slowing down when they hit land..

So, yes, catastrophic flooding from storms like Sally is climate change..

“(It was) slower than a turtle in peanut butter – a bad thing we're seeing more of because of climate change," said Mike Mann..

pic.twitter.com/ELqmo51VNS — Jeff Nesbit (@jeffnesbit) September 18, 2020  “This thing coming in at a [Category] 1, kind of sucker-punched us, everybody..

No one took it as seriously, including me, as we should have,” Gulf Shores, Alabama, Mayor Robert Craft told MSNBC as he explained they have received more than 50 human rescue calls..

The storm actually made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane after intensifying rapidly just before coming ashore..

Sally’s overwhelming rainfall is due, in part, to the fact that it moved “slower than a turtle in peanut butter … a bad thing we’re seeing more of because of climate change,” climate scientist Michael.

#Sally is moving slower than a turtle in peanut butter..

An that's a bad thing–a bad thing we're seeing more of because of climate change..

Via @HenryFountain in The @NYTimes: https://t.co/u7nHbTcaMx — Michael E. Mann (@MichaelEMann) September 16, 2020  Climate change is elevating flood risk in the U.S. by increasing the frequency of extr.

Science also indicates climate change is causing hurricanes, like Sally, to slow down, allowing the storms to dump more rain as they hover over affected areas for longer periods of time..

Ernest Nelson, a retired commercial fisherman in Bayou La Batra, Alabama, who has worked the water for decades, agreed with climate scientists that storms are getting bigger and more intense..

Local disaster relief warehouse sends thousands of supplies to Hurricane Sally victims.

DECATUR, Ala. (WAFF) - The United Methodist Disaster Relief Warehouse in Decatur is filled to the brim with crucial supplies needed when disaster strikes..

On Thursday, volunteers packed cleaning buckets to send down for Hurricane Sally clean up..

“We’ve already sent one semi truck load down earlier this week..

It’ll be at Loxley United Methodist Church by Friday..

We actually got another request last night for our cleaning buckets," Director Cindy Sandlin said..

Sandlin says that first truck took down nearly 800 buckets..

Dozens of supplies including detergent, dish soap, gloves, N-95 masks, trash bags, you name it, are in the cleaning buckets..

Each bucket can last a family of four, more than two weeks..

“We all know someone or have seen damage or knows people who have had damage..

You see on the TV how roofs are going out, wind is blowing, trees on houses..

You know what they need," volunteer Bill Padgett said..

Padgett has been volunteering at the warehouse for years and has delivered supplies to victims himself..

The warehouse team will be packing buckets the next several days and plan to send out another batch early next week..

Clouds stick around, sunshine and cool temperatures on the way.

Weekday broadcast of WYMT Mountain News at 6  HAZARD, Ky. (WYMT) - Today we saw some rain and we’ve seen those gloomy skies due to the remnants of Hurricane Sally..

Tonight and Tomorrow  Tonight we will continue to see those clouds stick around as the remannts of once Hurricane Sally moves out of the region..

However, a cold front does move through which will keep that cloud cover around for some of the day Friday..

Mostly cloudy skies continue tonight with temperatures dropping into the upper 50s to lower 60s..

We will start out your Friday with mostly cloudy skies..

I think most of us could only get into the upper 60s for highs..

‘IN ATTIC, HELP:' Firefighter on Jet Ski rescues Florida couple from Hurricane Sally.

Elaine and Jack Hulgan pose for a portrait after riding out the hurricane in their attic, Thursday, Sept. 17, 2020, in Cantonment, Fla..

Rivers swollen by Hurricane Sally's rains threatened more misery for parts of the Florida Panhandle and south Alabama on Thursday, as the storm's remnants continued to dump heavy rains inland that spr.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)  CANTONMENT, Fla. – The firetrucks and rescue vehicles kept passing her house even after Elaine Hulgan, 76, wrote “IN ATTIC HELP” on the front door..

So Hulgan’s 84-year-old husband resorted to his best emergency signal: an ear-splitting whistle..

The Florida couple was trapped in their home after Hurricane Sally lumbered ashore Wednesday morning near Gulf Shores, Alabama, with 105 mph (165 kph) winds..

At least one death has been attributed to the storm..

Now comes the tough part for Elaine and Jack Hulgan — filing insurance claims, dealing with two flooded cars, finding temporary housing and waiting to get home..

Ad  As others tuned out forecasts about Sally because it was initially projected to hit far west in Louisiana and then Mississippi, Elaine Hulgan started moving books and photos out of low cabinets in.

Her husband put the lawn mower atop a table on the back porch..

The rain from Sally started out light but soon changed into torrents..

Water began rising from 11 Mile Creek across the street..

The muddy water first got to the road and then their driveway before entering the yard..

It crept up to the entrance and was soon seeping under the front door..

As a mix of water from the rain, the creek and sewage overflows began filling the one-story house with the first of 20 inches (0.5 meters) of fetid water, the couple knew they had to do something..

Walking into the garage, past a new Toyota with just 35 miles (56 kilometers) on it, they climbed up the pull-down stairs to the attic overhead..

Ad  Soon they could hear trucks rumbling into their neighborhood, down the street and past their house..

“When they kept going by and not seeing us, I told Jack, ‘Jack, are the four of us going to die in this house?.

She used a can of spray paint to scrawl the message on the door, but things felt dire..

And Jack said, ‘We’ll just go back in the attic and stay there.’.

And he said, 'We aren’t going to die,'" Elaine said..

A firefighter finally heard the man’s whistling from the front door, and the Jet Ski was soon in the yard..

Rescuers used a small raft to remove them and the dogs..

While Jack is “pretty laid-back,” Elaine said she was worried horribly until they were rescued early Wednesday..

They first went to a community center and then the home of a friend..

Elaine Hulgan said they’re not sure where they might live while their home is being repaired, but they’re also thankful to be alive..

Ad  Jack “said everything was going to be OK, and it was,” she said..

PAWS, animal rescues rally to help animals after Hurricane Sally, prepare to help Pensacola.

FORT WALTON BEACH – No pets were allowed at Okaloosa County’s shelter for Hurricane Sally, the Raider Arena at Northwest Florida State College in Niceville..

As the county's contractor for animal control, that is where the Panhandle Animal Welfare Society comes in, said Tracey Williams, PAWS' executive director..

“If there’s a shelter that’s pet friendly, we would set up and intake the animals and take care of them while the families are resting,” Williams said..

“In this case, for this storm, there was not a pet-friendly shelter..

I got a call from the county at about 4:30 a.m. asking us to come out to the emergency operations center because people are starting to come there with animals.”.

The nonprofit has set up a mobile unit at the site so its staff can care for the dogs until evacuees can safely collect them..

As of Wednesday afternoon, the organization has taken in six dogs..

More:Alaqua Animal Refuge in Freeport underwater after flooding from Hurricane Sally  While weather has calmed some, the operation isn't over..

"We all keep thinking it’s slow and it’s gonna be done, but with rivers rising, we’re going to keep that open through Friday.".

And while the number of animals taken in locally was small, it could grow as the organization assists animal owners in Okaloosa and surrounding counties hit harder by Hurricane Sally..

Williams expects an influx from Okaloosa Island on Wednesday night..

The organization is preparing for what the next few days could look like..

“There’s a lot of folks who have come in to help the people of Pensacola,” Williams said..

“We’ve prepared one of our trailers already with kennels and sheets and dishes if they have to be transported over..

That’s what our staff has been focused on after feeding our animals.”.

PAWS has set up a trailer next to its facility on Lovejoy Road with 15 large kennels for animals from other areas..

“Our building itself is overflowing,” Williams said..

“We are stuffed already with animals, but we do have an extra trailer we don’t normally use that we have set up if animals show up.”.

While the parking lot on Lovejoy Road was flooded with about 2 feet of water, the organization’s Laurel Hill facility has it worse..

Williams is relieved they had just transferred horses from there..

"We’ve had horses there for a year that we were sheltering after they were neglected and malnourished," Williams said..

"They just got those horses re-homed the day before the storm..

The stables where the horses would’ve been are flooded..

"  Katie Healey, Laurel Hill's supervisor, said the building is the only thing not flooded..

“Our sewer is backing up, our pasture is flooding and all of our livestock pens are flooding,” Healey said..

“We’re actually in the process of transporting two goats and a pig to a rescue that can hang on to them at least until the storm is over or bring them back to us or find them forever homes..

We have sandbagged the whole outside of our shelter to hopefully be able to divert water so our kennels don’t overflow.”.

The facility has about 22 dogs and more than 80 cats to transport..

“We’re trying to work with rescues to get animals moved out and evacuated in case things get a little bit worse and also to make room for the surrounding counties that will potentially need help when .

One rescue on its way to pick up 12 dogs was rerouted multiple times..

“Many of the bridges are flooded out and there’s several road closures, so they’ve had to take alternate routes,” Healey said..

“During these times, rescues are always really good about banding together and pulling together transports to help all of us out,” Healey said..

“I’m not fearful we won’t be able to move the animals.”.

Gulf Coast braces for 2nd round of flooding in Sally’s wake.

PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — Rescuers on the Gulf Coast used boats and high-water vehicles Thursday to reach people cut off by floodwaters in the aftermath of Hurricane Sally, even as a second round of floo.

Across southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, homeowners and businesses began cleaning up, and officials inspected bridges and highways for safety, a day after Sally rolled through with 105 mph (.

Sally sped up late Thursday, moving at 15 mph compared to its previous crawl of 3 and 5 mph (5 and 8 kph), but was still dumping heavy rains in southeastern Virginia and eastern North Carolina, where .

The storm was expected to dump as much as 8 inches (20 centimeters) in parts of the Carolinas and southern Virginia, prompting warnings of flash flooding and moderate river flooding..

As much as 8 inches of rain fell in central Georgia on Thursday..

In hard-hit Pensacola and surrounding Escambia County, where Sally’s floodwaters had coursed through downtown streets and lapped at car door handles on Wednesday before receding, authorities went door.

“Please, please, we’re not out of the woods even if we’ve got beautiful skies today,” said Escambia County emergency manager Eric Gilmore..

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis urged Panhandle residents not to let their guard down..

“You’re going to see the rivers continue to rise,” DeSantis said after an aerial tour of the Panhandle..

Most rivers fed by the storm were cresting in Alabama and the Panhandle on Thursday, although the Shoal, in Florida was still rising, said Steve Miller of the National Weather Service in Mobile, Alaba.

Near Crestview, Florida, portions of Interstate 10 and U.S. Highway 90 — the two main roadways running east to west through the Panhandle — were closed because of flooding from the Shoal, the Florida .

Crews carried out at least 400 rescues in Escambia County, Florida, by such means as high-water vehicles, boats and water scooters, authorities said..

Rescuers focused their efforts Thursday on Innerarity Point, a narrow strip of land close to Pensacola that is home to waterfront homes and businesses..

Richard Wittig and his family were among scores of people hemmed in by floodwaters on an island at the tip of the point..

“If I didn’t have a working generator, we’d be dead..

He said he and his son rely on oxygen machines to stay alive..

The Florida National Guard said it had deployed about 500 soldiers and airmen to help local authorities evacuate 113 people, though it did not say when and where the rescues took place..

In Alabama, on both sides of Mobile Bay, National Guard soldiers from high-water evacuation teams used big trucks Thursday to rescue at least 35 people, authorities said..

A volunteer rescue group based on Marcos Island, Florida, known as the Marcos Patriots, received three calls for help, including from an 80-year-old woman in Gulf Shores, Alabama, whose roof had blown.

When a rescue team arrived, “she was safe and sound with a neighbor but her house was destroyed,” said group co-founder ErinMia Milchman..

About 35 miles (56 kilometers) inland, a swollen Murder Creek cut off access between the Alabama towns of Brewton and East Brewton, inundating a grocery store, a tobacco shop, a park and more..

Residents behind a police roadblock gazed at the neighboring city across fast-moving water covering a bridge..

East Brewton resident Brenda Davenport said it took only four hours for the water to rise..

“It could take two days for it to go down,” she said..

In Orange Beach, Alabama, Janice Sullivan swore she would never ride out a hurricane again..

She and her daughter huddled in a second-floor bathroom as Sally blew ashore..

“You could hear everything hitting the house,” she said..

Susan Cutts' parents fled rising water inside their home into the garage, where they desperately called for help on a dying cellphone until aid arrived..

At least one death, in Alabama, was blamed on the hurricane..

Nearly 400,000 homes and businesses were still without power Thursday night, mostly in Alabama and Florida..

At a downtown marina, at least 30 sailboats, fishing boats and other vessels were clumped together in a mass of fiberglass hulls and broken docks..

Also on Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said a new tropical depression formed in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico..

(William Widmer/The New York Times)  PENSACOLA — Rivers swollen by Hurricane Sally’s rains threatened more misery for parts of the Florida Panhandle and south Alabama on Thursday, even as the storm’s .

Sally, now downgraded to a tropical depression, is 50 miles southeast of Montgomery, Alabama and moving at 12 mph, with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center’s .

Advertisement  Sally rapidly intensified into a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph as it made landfall in Gulf Shores, Alabama at around 6 a.m. Wednesday..

The storm landed at a sluggish speed of 2 mph, giving it an extended period of time to besiege the Gulf Coast with 7-foot storm surge and more than 2 feet of rainfall..

Sally’s slow tour through Alabama and the west Florida Panhandle brought destruction of property, downed power lines and flooded roadways..

A section of the Three Mile Bridge in Pensacola went missing during the storm Wednesday after Sally pushed a construction barge into a support beam, according to Santa Rosa County Emergency Management.

Advertisement  As the storm continues to move from Alabama and into Georgia, it leaves behind over 500,000 people in the dark with customers from Alabama, Georgia and Florida without power, as of 7:30.

Sally is forecast to weaken further and degenerate into a post tropical cyclone/remnant low early Friday while encountering vertical wind shear as it passes over west-central Georgia, the NHC said..

DeSantis was scheduled to give an update after taking an aerial tour of damage Thursday afternoon..

On Wednesday he said 500 members of the Florida National Guard had been deployed to assist in evacuations amid the rising floodwaters..

The National Guard said in a release they had helped evacuate 113 Florida residents as of Thursday afternoon..

Sally moved slowly, exacerbating the heavy rains' effects..

More than 2 feet fell near Naval Air Station Pensacola, and nearly 3 feet of water covered streets in downtown Pensacola, the National Weather Service reported..

At a downtown marina, at least 30 sailboats, fishing boats and cabin cruisers were clumped together Thursday in a mass of fiberglass hulls and broken docks..

The hurricane also drove two large ferry boats into a concrete sea wall and left them grounded..

Both the Turtle Runner and the Pelican Perch were purchased with BP oil spill money and used for trips between the city and the beach..

A replica of Christopher Columbus' ship the Nina was missing from where it was docked at the Pensacola waterfront, police said..

The storm was located early Thursday about 625 miles east-northeast of The Lesser Antilles..

Teddy was moving toward the northwest at about 12 mph, the general motion it is expected to continue through the weekend..

Additional strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days; Teddy could become a major hurricane Thursday night or Friday, the National Hurricane Center said..

Gov. DeSantis views the damage Hurricane Sally left behind in Escambia, Santa Rosa counties.

State officials are investigating how a barge came unmoored during Hurricane Sally and heavily damaged Three Mile Bridge across Pensacola Bay, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday after surveying storm dam.

During a news conference at Pensacola International Airport, a reporter asked the governor whether negligence was suspected in the accident, which sent a section of the bridge to the bottom of the bay.

“FDOT is looking into that,” he said, referring to the Florida Department of Transportation..

But he added that Sally’s late ”wobble” to the east — off a course that appeared headed to Mississippi, may have caught people in Pensacola off guard..

State leaders had assumed that was a possibility and prepared for it, staging emergency responders and supplies nearby just in case, DeSantis said..

“I’d much rather have precautions taken and then not have to use what every resources,” he said..

“Clearly, it’s done a lot of damage,” DeSantis said of the barge..

“If you live in some of those areas and don’t have access to that bridge it will be very difficult for people go get around.”.

The bridge carries U.S. Highway 98 between Pensacola and Gulf Breeze..

It’s been damaged before, the Pensacola News Journal reported, including in 1989, when a different barge strike closed it for 224 days and forced a 45-mile detour..

DeSantis and his entourage — including First Lady Casey DeSantis, emergency management director Jared Moskowitz, U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, Pensacola Mayor Grover Ro.

Sally made landfall as a strong Category 2 storm just west of Pensacola, bringing strong winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall..

The survey revealed some areas with standing water, DeSantis said..

“Like down in Perdido Key, you kind of have homes and there was just water — it was almost like the home was an island,” he said..

Elsewhere waters had appeared to have receded leaving damage that wasn’t apparent from the air..

There have been no reports of fatalities in Florida, the governor said, but the 500 National Guard members he’s deployed have performed more than 100 rescues and Fish and Wildlife Commission officers .

Restoring power is a “major, major” imperative, he said..

At the peak of the storm 250,000 homes were without electricity; some 40,000 have seen it restored..

He’s told Highway Patrol officers and DOT officials to “do whatever you need to do” to help repair crews access line breaks..

The state has deployed 200 generators to run traffic lights and truck-mounted light towers so that repairs can continue over night, he said..

Additionally, the state has sent in 972,000 bottles of water and 179,000 meals and is establishing mobile kitchens..

Eight-five residents of an assisted living facility that lost power were transferred to another facility owned by the same company while observing COVID-19 protections, the governor said..

He did not mention whether the home had a working generator, as required by state law..

Listen to local officials as new advisories may come out..

And, of course be careful around standing water — it can be very, very hazardous,” the governor said..

Panama City Beach neighborhood under water due to Hurricane Sally.

PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (WJHG/WECP) -  Residents on Faith Lane in Panama City Beach found themselves stranded inside their homes Wednesday due to flooding in their neighborhood..

“We knew that it was going to do what it was going to do..

I mean, it just started staying and won’t go (anywhere)..

We’re tired of it," resident Sheila Matthews said..

On Tuesday, the homes were merely threatened with growing puddles of floodwaters..

“Got a little bit of sleep, wake up at 8:30 this morning to a lake in my front yard," resident Heath Armstrong said..

The floodwaters reached up to some neighbors' knees..

I just can’t believe what I’m seeing out here," Vivian Strickler said, who is temporarily living in a house on Faith Lane..

Neighbors said they expected it and did their best to prepare but in the end, Hurricane Sally welcomed itself into their homes..

“We’re shoveling water out of our screened-in porch..

Our dam didn’t break or anything, it’s just seeping in from the bottom," Matthews said..

“It’s really upsetting me because this is my home and I don’t want to lose my home," resident Judy Towns said..

They said the flooding is a constant problem, and they say no one has given them a solution..

Everybody on this little corner is just about to their wit’s end..

People are actually wanting to sell and leave," Matthews said. ".

The city, the county, whatever, somebody needs to do something.”.

Neighbors went on to say they don’t expect the flooding to completely go down for at least another day..

Lynn Haven homes, roadways flood after Hurricane Sally.

LYNN HAVEN, Fla. (WJHG/WECP) -  Like many areas across the panhandle, Lynn Haven saw some pretty heavy flooding from Hurricane Sally, and officials say it could last for a while.  ”.

So we’re going to deal with this for another 24 to 48 hours," said Lynn Haven Police Chief Ricky Ramie..

Lynn Haven homes like Bill Savelle’s off of Fourth Street saw their roads become almost impassible..

“Right now it’s high tide so it’s a lot worse than what it normally is,” said Savelle..

Savelle and his family have lived in their home since the 70s and have seen their fair share of storms but say Sally was different..

I have seen it when it [the water] was up in the driveway," said Savelle..

“This has been the most water I’ve seen since I’ve been here almost three years," said Ramie..

It wasn’t just residential areas that flooded, many main roadways in Lynn Haven like Highway 77 were also underwater..

Chief Ramie says unless it’s an emergency, stay off the road..

“We’re up to nine vehicles that have either stalled or drove off in ditches..

So on top of every other call that we have and a high call volume, we’re having to deal with sightseers," said Ramie..

As the storm moves off and locals assess the damage, Chief Ramie and law enforcement officials will work to keep the roadways and citizens safe, while Savelle and his family recover and prepare in cas.

“ [We’ll] Ride it out for right now and do what we’ve gotta do," said Savelle..

Officials say they hope the low tide will help ease some of this water out of the roadways..

DIAMONDHEAD, Miss. (WLOX) - The City of Diamondhead was all set for a special election on Tuesday where two candidates qualified to replace former Mayor Tommy Schafer who died in July..

But, Hurricane Sally blew those plans away and the city had to postpone their special election..

Now, the city’s problem is that there is almost no legal precedent for rescheduling an election on such short notice..

“There’s been no opinions and there’s been no laws or statutes to refer to in handling this matter,” said Diamondhead City Clerk Jeannie Klein..

“So we’re basically in uncharted waters with this election.”.

Klein had everything set for the election, this included voting machines borrowed from Hancock County, hand sanitizers and cotton swabs for voters to use on the electronic voting machines..

About 200 absentee ballots had already been cast in the election, but now those ballots are ‘under lock and key’ and most likely will not be counted because they are dated for the September 15 electio.

The city has consulted with the Secretary of State’s Office, the State Attorney General and local counsel for advice on how to move forward..

The city council hoped to be able to schedule a new election date during an emergency meeting Friday afternoon at 5 p.m. and not have to start over from scratch..

“Our goal with the election being reset by the council tomorrow night is to make sure that all candidates are treated equally and all electors of the city get their opportunity to vote.”.

The two candidates running for the Diamondhead Mayor’s seat are Diamondhead Councilwoman Nancy Depreo and Attorney Richard Willis..

'More water than we know what to do with': Hurricane Sally floods parts of Big Bend.

Hurricane Sally dumped massive amounts of rain over parts of the Big Bend as it slowly moved onshore, sending floodwaters into homes and businesses, washing out roads and overwhelming rivers and creek.

Tallahassee escaped major calamity as Sally made landfall Wednesday along the Alabama coast — only one home was reported damaged by a tree, and power was restored quickly for the several thousand cust.

But the hurricane and its relentless rain bands hit harder further west..

“There was just nowhere for the water to go,” said Corey Silcox, director of Calhoun County Emergency Management..

“It came off the roads and leaned up against houses and came into their doors..

But the rural county and its neighbor to the north, Jackson County, were bracing for even more water as rainfall from Sally flows down from the north..

The National Weather Service in Tallahassee issued flood warnings for the Chipola River, where major flooding was expected in Marianna and Altha, and the Apalachicola River, where moderate flooding wa.

Kelly Godsey, meteorologist with the Weather Service, said storm totals over the past five days varied from 5-7 inches in Tallahassee to 8-14 inches in points west, including Gadsden and Liberty count.

He urged residents to be aware of rising water, especially at night..

“It has been a while since we’ve seen these levels and there’s a lot of area that has flooded,” Godsey said..

“So as we go through the next few days and we see the main stem rivers rise, people just need to be aware of those higher water levels and remain very cautious near any of the rivers.”.

In Gadsden County, floodwaters wiped out a portion of Cane Creek Road, damaged several other roads and prompted the temporary closure of interstate exits..

“It reminded me of being in South America,” said Shawn Wood, director of Emergency Management there..

At the Woodruff Dam on the swollen Apalachicola River near Chattahoochee, water levels are expected to reach 66-68 feet, just a few feet under moderate flood levels..

But Wood worried it could get higher with more rain and water from elsewhere..

“We got the water from the sky, and now we’re getting water from the north,” he said..

In Liberty County, heavy rain surrounded some homes but didn’t get inside, said Rhonda Lewis, director of Emergency Management..

It got into a few businesses and a school, W.R. Tolar K-8 in Bristol, but receded quickly..

But we don’t have anybody that’s totally isolated..

We’ve got more water than we know what to do with — I wish we could ship it to California.”.

Shelters opened in Calhoun County, but no one stayed in them overnight, Silcox said..

He said he hopes residents will take advantage of the shelters if waters rise to dangerous levels..

“That’s the thing about Calhoun County — people are so prideful and they’ve been exposed to so much of this they don’t really ask for help,” he said..

Kevin Peters, director of Leon County Emergency Management, said the community was lucky to escape the magnitude of damage seen to the west, including hard-hit Escambia and Santa Rosa counties..

He urged residents to keep their guard up, noting that Hurricane Michael made landfall in the month of October in 2018 and Hurricane Kate in November 1985..

“We’re still in the middle of hurricane season,” Peters said..

“I encourage citizens to continue to be prepared and keep an eye on the tropics.”.

Hurricane Sally unleashes torrential rains in US Gulf coast.

Hurricane Sally has made landfall along the Gulf coast of the United States, unleashing torrential rain and 165km/h (103mph) winds..

The Category 2 storm is moving so slowly it is likely to cause days of downpours and what is being called historic floods..

Destin's charter boats ride out Hurricane Sally in harbor.

Some untied and pulled off extra ropes, others unloaded hurricane anchors and chains, while some sat and waited for the power to come back on..

Either way, Destin charter boat captains and deckhands were thankful they survived Hurricane Sally mostly unscathed..

"We lucked out," said Capt. Scott Robson of the charter boat Phoenix at HarborWalk Marina..

Usually when a hurricane threatens in the Gulf of Mexico, Destin's charter fleet takes cover in Choctawhatchee Bay or the bayous, or even over in Freeport or up the Intracoastal Waterway..

But with the initial track for Sally not a threat, captains decided to leave their boats in their slips along the Destin harbor..

"When it started to wobbling this way, it was too late to leave," said Capt. Eric Thrasher of the charter boat Game On at Fishing Fleet Marina..

There was no leaving; just tie up the best you can," Thrasher added, who noted that he tied on eight extra ropes..

At the end of the docks near the Fisherman's Coop fuel pumps and Thrasher's boat, he said the water was about knee deep..

Storm related:River flood warnings issued for northern counties in Northwest Florida  And before it was all said and done, the water was up in the parking lot..

Thrasher pointed to a spot about 10 feet from the boardwalk in the parking lot and said, "That was the tide line.".

On Thursday morning the water had dropped, but the boats were still sitting high in their slips with the names on the back of the boats visible as you walked up and down..

Several of the captains were just waiting to get electricity back on the docks..

"We've been having to run generators," said Capt. Robert Hill of the Twilight..

The captains depend on the electricity to keep all their batteries charged and for their live wells..

However, Robson said the parking lot had been flooded and the water had risen all the way to the food trucks that line the back wall at the marina..

"We really missed a bullet," said Robson, who noted the destruction to boats over in Orange Beach, Alabama..

... It's that sea surge that gets you," he said, noting that he'll leave for the next storm that threatens..

Robson's deckhand, Justin Brantley, was at the boat off and on during the storm..

"I could barely stand up," Brantley said of checking on the boat and adding extra ropes..

He said he sat up in the bridge of the boat so he could see what was going on..

"The ropes were stretched out as far as they could be," Brantley said..

One interesting tidbit that Brantley saw during the craziness was cockroaches..

"Cockroaches were up on the pilings and on the tables (trying to get away from the water)," he said..

Storm related:Alaqua Animal Refuge in Freeport underwater after flooding from Hurricane Sally  Capt. Josh Glidden of the Just Reel at East Pass Marina came down Tuesday night as Sally was blowing thro.

"I stayed up in the breezeway of the two buildings (and just watched)," Glidden said..

"I found it in the back of the parking lot," said Glidden, thankful that was the only damage..

The charter boat Missin Piece that moors on the back dock at East Pass didn't fare as well..

It was flipped on its side and pretty much sunk in its slip..

Some of the captains said they had checked on it as early as 6 a.m. Wednesday and it was still upright..

So some time after that it had rolled on its side..

As for the boats that dock behind AJ's Seafood and Oyster Bar, they appeared to be intact..

"We just put on a few extra ropes," said Capt. Joe Quaranto of the Silver Lining, who noted that he did not stay on the boat..

You never know ... but once we knew, it was too nasty out (to move the boat)..

At one point he got them all in a closet because of threats of tornadoes..

"Got to be more prepared next time for the uncertainty..

The next one I might run up to Freeport," Quaranto said..

PANAMA CITY, Fla. (PRESS RELEASE) - Due to the heavy rains and the loss of power caused by Hurricane Sally, our Water and Sewer Department is dealing with several sanitary sewer overflows in its Count.

The large majority of County West’s 26 lift stations which are serviced by the Russell Stephenson Water Reclamation Facility were overwhelmed and/or submerged during Sally’s move onshore September 16t.

The area received 22″ of rain – 19″ of it on the 16th..

As the area lost power during the storm, the situation further deteriorated for the lift stations..

During the storm, Water and Sewer was closely monitoring the system and the associated alarms through various forms of telemetry..

However, the wastewater collection system was not able to handle prolonged mass power outages paired with the unprecedented rain..

The system typically, in which all 26 lift stations were functioning well before the storm made landfall, flows around 500,000 gallons per day on an average day..

“Okaloosa County Water and Sewer Staff is now completely focused on minimizing the amount of sanitary sewer overflows by using stationary generators, portable generators, and bypass pumps,” said Water.

Water and Sewer staff is coordinating with the Florida Department of Environmental and the Florida Department of Health to estimate the spill volume..

Sanitary sewer overflows from this collection system follow the historical drainage patterns and ultimately discharge into Santa Rosa Sound..

"We will continue to work this spill until power is back on and operations have resumed..

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) - The Tallahassee International Airport is currently serving as a Logistical Staging Area for state emergency operations in the wake of Hurricane Sally..

The airport was notified by the state on Tuesday that it would be the best option for an LSA; they’ve been preparing since then..

Deputy Director of Aviation Jim Durwin says quite a bit of equipment has already been transported west, but more is still coming in..

The airport has converted a taxiway, lining up semi trailers, filled with water, food, tarps, and other supplies..

You can also find generators, pumps, forklifts, lights, and all kinds of equipment in the parking lot..

With all of these operations, TLH still has to continue regular daily services..

“It’s a challenge, but it’s one that we’re certainly up to, and we’re proud to be able to participate in..

We appreciate the opportunity to help out, because we know just how important that activity is,” said Durwin..

Durwin also says there could be aviation support coming to the airport, so you may see helicopters in the area in the coming days..

He anticipates the LSA could be open for weeks, depending on the damage out west..

New Orleans 911 operators help out in hurricane-stricken Alabama.

Operators answer emergency calls at Orleans Parish 911 Call Center..

(Source: WVUE)  NEW ORLEANS, La. (WVUE) - Inside the Orleans Parish Communications District’s 911 call center operators were busy responding to citizens calls..

But several of their co-workers were many miles away in Alabama assisting victims of Hurricane Sally..

Tyrell Morris is Executive Director of the Orleans Parish Communications District..

“911 centers, we really are the gateway to government for everyone, emergency or not,” he said..

The team of New Orleans emergency telecommunicators left Wednesday evening and are now at work in Alabama..

“They have been boots on the ground with the Alabama’s Baldwin Country 911, helping the folks there on the ground..

It is an opportunity for emergency communications professionals around the country to really help each other out..

Here in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina we received all kinds of support,” said Morris..

Morris is also the coordinator for LA-TERT, which stands for Louisiana’s Telecommunicator Emergency Response Task Force..

He handles out-of-state requests for assistance from telecommunications specialists through the national TERT program..

“So, when those requests come to Louisiana, they come to me..

I work with the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency preparedness to fill those requests,” said Morris..

Fulfilling Baldwin County’s request was almost immediate, according to Morris..

“They find the TERT team that’s available, ours was available and so we received a call yesterday morning around 9 a.m. from Alabama, Baldwin County 911 to be exact, they were having a major increase .

Morris said five staffers from Orleans Parish joined three from Bossier and St. Landry parishes to make the trip to Alabama..

“It’s a combination of call-takers, dispatchers and supervisors that have multiple skills,” said Morris..

Alabama’s Gov. Kay Ivey said the storm has caused more than just property damage, but also widespread power outages and she urged residents to be patient..

“Y’all I know, it’s uncomfortable and downright scary to be sitting in the darkness of your home without any lights, but please be patient..

These linemen will be working at warp speed to try to get your power restored,” said Ivey..

Electricity is always an early casualty of hurricanes..

Entergy which serves over a million customers in Louisiana said it has crews in Alabama and Florida helping to restore electricity..

And people in New Orleans know well the pain and devastation hurricanes can cause, so Morris says it feels good to be able to help a neighboring state..

“We’re all in this together and we all have the same mission, so we will always rise to the call when we’re called by other organizations to provide some assistance,” he said..

WDHN Storm Team: Sally weakening, but extreme impacts continue.

DOTHAN, Ala. (WDHN) — Hurricane Sally has brought it’s most intense impacts to Southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle today: flooded roadways, multiple submerged vehicles, eroded beaches, and nume.

While Sally is clearly weakening this evening, it’s safe to say that we are NOT in the clear just yet..

What we can still expect:  Tropical Storm winds/gusts are still possible for many Tri-State residents, but the primary wind threat is in our northern and eastern counties..

Sally’s winds will diminish much more rapidly than other aspects of the storm..

Power outages caused by fallen tree branches and road closures due to upended trees (from the saturated ground and winds combined) will still likely be seen tonight for many..

The NWS issued a catastrophic flood potential for Northern Coffee and Dale Counties earlier today..

That extreme flooding risk continues tonight for the entirety of both counties, but is a little less extreme for southern residents of Dale and Coffee Counties..

Many of the current Flash Flood Warnings will continue until about ten o’clock or even midnight tonight..

If you see a flooded roadway, TURN AROUND, DON’T DROWN!.

Two people in Dothan had to be rescued today when their Jeep became submerged at the intersection of Twitchell Rd. and Leona St. according to reports..

These situations can be entirely avoided if people choose to take a different route instead of risking their lives..

What has decreased:  The tornado watch has expired this evening for our entire area..

The threat for tornadoes has moved farther east into South-Central GA..

We’ll continue watching for possible brief spin-ups, but not much is expected in the Wiregrass..

Rain has diminished significantly for many of our southern counties, but banding is still currently occurring in Houston Co..

These rain bands could pop back up over different areas tonight especially, so the threat is not over..

The absolute heaviest rainfall has now moved into Pike and Barbour Counties..

Beyond Sally, there is potential for rain this weekend as another system develops in the Gulf and interacts with a cold front that will sweep across the Southeast US..

We’ll monitor that especially since we are already inundated throughout the Tri-State..

However, that same cold front will create significantly better conditions starting Monday and Tuesday..

Sally aftermath: Florida couple scramble into attic to avoid floodwaters.

CANTONMENT, Fla. — A Florida couple escaped the rising waters caused when Hurricane Sally made landfall early Wednesday, climbing into their attic as water streamed into their home..

Jack Hulgan, 84, and Elane Hulgan,76, were trapped for nearly two hours in their Cantonment attic as water poured into their home around the door frame and through window sills, the Pensacola News Jou.

The couple was unable to reach 911 for help, so they improvised..

“I had some blue spray paint, you know, out of a can?.

Well, I opened my front door and put ‘In Attic HELP’ right on the door,” Elane Hulgan told the newspaper..

“They must have seen my note because they came up riding these things.”.

Hurricane Sally Could Bring Flooding To The Jersey Shore.

Hurricane Sally Could Bring Flooding To The Jersey Shore  Hurricane Sally may be downgraded to just a tropical storm but as it sweeps it’s way across the country, New Jersey shore towns will get a tou.

The current path of Sally has it heading through North Carolina and out near Virginia Beach..

While we won’t see the rain or much wind from this storm we might see some moderate flooding..

According to the National Weather Service Philadelphia Mount Holly, Sally will be passing by us on a weekend when we would normally see higher tides due to the new moon..

The highest of tides will take place late Friday night and again at noon on Saturday and will be around 7 feet..

This is normal BUT with the passing of Sally we could see these tides rise anywhere from 6 inches to 9 inches..

The best thing you can due is just prepare for the flooding..

Move your car to higher ground, tie down anything that could float and close your garage door..

It looks like the US Army Corps of Engineers will take this opportunity of higher tides to try and get the barge off the N. Wildwood beach..

If you are unaware of whats going on, a barge is currently stuck on the N. Wildwood beach..

Hurricane Sally Makes Landfall in Same Spot, Exactly 16 Years Later, as Hurricane Ivan.

As local residents braced for impact, Hurricane Sally touched down on land in Alabama on Wednesday morning..

But what locals didn’t expect is that, despite being hurricane season, Sally made landfall in the same spot, exactly 16 years to the day later, as Hurricane Ivan, which also struck Gulf Shores in 2004.

Photo credit Getty Images  Both hurricanes reached land only about 15 miles apart, reports CNN..

In addition to the same day and location, the two hurricanes shared nearly the same time of reaching land — Sally arrived just before 6am, while Ivan hit the shores at 3am on that early September 2004.

Despite the similarities — which extend even to the storms’ similar tracks — one crucial difference is the speed of the hurricanes..

Related  On Sept. 16, 2004, Ivan pummeled the area, rapidly scouring the area with landfall winds of 13 mph..

Sally, on the other hand, only hit land at about 2 mph..

Related  When it hit, Ivan was catastrophic, responsible for 57 deaths in the U.S. and causing $27 billion in damage in the country, reports Pensacola News Journal..

'So many hazards': NASA photo shows North America covered in wildfire smoke as hurricanes move in.

TORONTO -- A new satellite image from NASA shows the West Coast of the U.S. and parts of Canada covered in smoke from growing wildfires while Hurricane Sally makes landfall in the Gulf Coast and sever.

The new image, captured Sept. 15 by NASA's Aqua satellite, shows the startling effect climate change is having on natural disasters, and scientists say these disasters may worsen or become more freque.

The true-colour image shows wildfires along the West Coast, smoke from those fires covering North America and several hurricanes moving in on the continent from different angles..

NASA said in a statement that capturing so many disasters in a single photo is rare..

"Satellite images are generated every single day, in fact multiple times from multiple satellites, but it is still very unusual to capture an image of so many hazards in one image," the space agency s.

NASA noted that the red points in the image show areas that are "significantly higher in temperature than the areas around it" and are indicative of fires..

The agency added that these points are most pronounced up and down the U.S. west coast, but blanket the entire country..

The wildfires have reached record-breaking proportions in California, Oregon and Washington and the satellite image shows smoke from these areas starting to spreading across parts of Canada..

The smoke from the wildfires is so dense and huge it has even spread as far as to Europe, according to observations from the EU's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service..

Cold Front Arrives Very Cool Early Autumn Weather This Weekend.

Cold Front Arrives Very Cool Early Autumn Weather This Weekend  WEATHER IN 5 PODCAST  Today we see the change in air masses as we have a cold front approaching and we see the remaining rain from Hurri.

Clouds are to our south and the area is sliding more to the east than to the north..

The cold front that will be coming through tonight really won’t have much with it..

We will spend the day in sunshine and some clouds..

It will warm up today though the smokey haze from the wild fires continues..

That cuts down on the daytime heating so highs today will be mostly in the 70s..

SATELLITE  REGIONAL RADAR  Tonight the rain from the south will make it far enough north to bring a brief period of rain for Southern New Jersey and maybe it touches Eastern Long Island..

Rainfall amounts will be minimal and any showers really should be few and far between overnight..

Friday will start with lots of clouds but as the frontal wave to the east moves away weather conditions will improve..

We should have decreasing clouds and increasing sunshine as Friday wears on..

This is going to set us up for a very cool weekend..

High pressure will be building in from the north giving us an early taste of Autumn..

Saturday morning lows will be in the 40s to near 50 in many locations and 30s will be common across Northern Pennsylvania northeast into New England..

Saturday highs will be just in the 60s with cool areas well north mostly in the 50s..

We should see lots of sunshine all weekend though again we will be dealing with the smokey haze due to the wild fires..

Sunday morning we will again in the 40s with 30s in cold spots north and west of the coast and highs will be again just in the 60s..

It seems we could be dry all of next week and we will be on the cool side of normal much of the time..

On the lower right we see Hurricane Teddy taking a run at Bermuda Sunday night into Monday..

After that there is some uncertainty regarding whether Teddy takes a track straight north or does it slide out more to the east..

A straight north motion could mean a threat to Nova Scotia or even Southeast Maine..

Also we will likely see another tropical storm develop in the Western Gulf of Mexico over the next several days..

Neither storm is an issue for Eastern Pennsylvania to Southern New England..

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Thursday flew over Northwest Florida to see firsthand the damage caused by Hurricane Sally..

He said no deaths had been attributed to the storm and that power restoration and repairing Pensacola Bay Bridge are top priorities..

Senator Doug Broxson said contractor Skanska, which is constructing the new Pensacola Bay Bridge, made a “big mistake” by not properly ensuring barges would be secure during the storm..

He said it is believed that 5 barges used during construction of the new Pensacola Bay Bridge were “out of control” and that some had heavy equipment on them when they slammed into the structure, caus.

Two other bridges, Garcon Point Bridge and the bridge at NAS Pensacola, were also struck by runaway barges..

“They should have moved the barges,” Broxson said, noting he feels the contractor listened to weather forecasts, which initially predicted the storm would hit along the Louisiana/Mississippi border..

Broxson said the state plans to pursue an expedited, emergency repair of the bridge which could take 30-60 days to complete..

DeSantis went on to say the Florida Department of Emergency Management is bringing in extra fuel from Louisiana..

So far 972,000 water bottles and 179,000 meals have been provided to impacted areas..

Additionally, the state has made 100 rescues in addition to rescue efforts by local emergency agencies, including 20 rescues by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission..

DeSantis noted that some power restoration efforts are being hampered by flooding..

According to Gulf Power, the company has restored power to 32,930 customers in Santa Rosa County, although 41,270 still remain without power..

In Escambia County, more than 100,000 customers remain without power..

DeSantis said the state is coordinating with utility companies, which are working 24/7 to restore power..

VIDEO: Astounding view of Orange Beach devastation from drone after Sally.

ORANGE BEACH, Ala. (WKRG) — Hurricane Sally ravaged the Gulf Coast..

Drone video from the area shows the astounding level of damage, Sally showing incredible strength along the coast..

These boats in the video box seen above belong at condos much further up the beach..

The winds were so strong, hardly any boats left out are not displaced or damaged..

People who live at nearby condos lost boats of their own..

All agreed they did not expect Hurricane Sally to move this far east and certainly were not expecting this long of a recovery process..

Robert Quinn lost a boat, “after a while you don’t want to see the damage anymore..

You look out your condo and instead of seeing a beautiful bunch of boats riding by and everybody having fun, you see tons of wood, you see all that kind of stuff which makes it totally depressing, “ri.

​PATH OF HURRICANE SALLY LEAVES WAR-LIKE DESTRUCTION, FLOODING, AT LEAST ONE DEATH & 600,000 WITHOUT POWER.

In Gulf Shores, Alabama, where Sally made landfall on Wednesday morning as a Category 2 hurricane in Gulf Shores, Alabama, about 30 miles west of Pensacola..

The 105-mph winds toppled trees and telephone poles and tore the roofs off some homes..

The slow-moving soaker pounded some areas of Florida and Alabama with 2 feet of rain or more..

Sally weakened to a tropical depression on Wednesday but was cutting a swath through the Southeast on Thursday, putting 20 million people from Georgia through southeastern Virginia under flash flood a.

Sally, which slammed Florida and Alabama as a powerful Category 2 hurricane, left heavy flooding, destroyed buildings, 500,000 homes and businesses without power..

“It looks like a war zone to me,” one Florida resident told NBC’s “TODAY” on Thursday..

Parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia could see a foot of rain before the storm’s remnants slide into the Atlantic..

And, days after the storm has passed, swollen rivers could push eight waterways in Florida and Alabama to record-high levels, authorities warned..

More than 220,000 Florida power customers remained in the dark Thursday..

Almost 300,000 power customers in Alabama, more than 50,000 in Louisiana and 40,000 in Georgia were also dark..

Coastal flooding and ocean overwash a concern as Sally and Teddy impact the OBX.

Coastal flooding and ocean overwash due to heavy rainfall, high astronomical tides, increasing swell from Hurricane Teddy, and a prolonged northeast wind will remain a concern through the weekend, per.

The imminent severe weather is expected to be a long-duration event through multiple tide cycles starting on Friday, and lasting through the weekend..

At high tide, significant ocean overwash is expected, with N.C. Highway 12 possibly being impacted..

Beach erosion is also likely, with 7-to-12 foot waves forecasted through the weekend..

The next high tide is at approximately 8:00-8:30 p.m. on Thursday night..

Heavy rains are also expected to continue through Thursday night..

Ponding of water on roads is likely, with flash flooding possible where the heaviest rain occurs..

A Flash Flood Watch remains in effect for all of eastern North Carolina..

A high risk of rip currents is also in effect for all Outer Banks beaches on Friday..

The elevated rip current risk will continue through the weekend, due to the dangerous surf and swell produced by Hurricane Teddy..

Farther north, scattered severe thunderstorms are still possible overnight..

A few storms could become strong to severe, producing damaging wind gusts with isolated tornadoes possible..

With strong storms overnight, the public is advised to have multiple ways to receive warnings..

There are two areas of interest the National Hurricane Center is watching now, and one of them is in the Gulf..

If both become named storms, one will be Wilfred and the other “Alpha” as we begin the Greek Alphabet..

There is a chance that future-Wilfred could impact the northern Gulf Coast (LA, MS, AL, FL) in the next 7-10 days..

It’s far too soon to ‘know’ if it will be a problem for already hard hit areas from Laura and Sally, but it bears watching!.

We are just a week past the peak of the Atlantic Hurricane Season (September 10th is the climatological peak), so just average activity from here on out gives us four more storms:  Wilfred  Alpha  Bet.

Rain has spread across the Mid Atlantic states and is now in range of our local radars below..

However the front should push this rain to the east over night..

While Southern New Jersey and perhaps Long Island get into some of this rain overnight, it should be moving away to the east by daybreak..

Temperatures overnight will hold in the 60s thanks to all the cloud cover..

Inland areas might see a passing shower overnight but nothing more..

SATELLITE  REGIONAL RADAR  A rather large area of rain is covering the Carolinas and Virginia with the northern edge into Southern New Jersey this evening..

This rain area will move northeast and we will watch the northern edge pivot around and begin to slide eastward overnight..

Rainfall amounts if any will be under a tenth of an inch while areas to the south from Southern New Jersey southward will get a bit more..

LOCAL RADAR NEW YORK CITY  LOCAL RADAR PHILADELPHIA    Friday we will see cool air arriving on the back side of this weather front and high pressure will start to build in from the Great Lakes..

This is a very cool high and it will be with us in one form or another right into the start of next week..

Look for decreasing clouds on Friday with some sunshine developing from northwest to southeast during the afternoon..

A gusty breeze will develop and temperatures will hold in the 60s..

Autumn arrives on Tuesday however this weekend autumn weather will take hold..

Saturday morning lows will be in the 40s except for lower 50s over warmer urban settings and along the coast..

We will see lots of sunshine Saturday with highs just in the 60s..

Saturday night will be nice and clear and it will be another rather chilly night..

Sunday morning lows will be in the 40s to around 50 and northern areas in Pennsylvania and the Hudson Valley will see their first 30s since back late last spring..

Those cold spots might even see some frosts and freezes out of this..

Sunday we will have lots of sunshine with highs again just in the 60s and some areas inland might have a tough time getting above the 60 degree mark..

Down we go again Sunday night and then Monday more of the same with sunshine and highs in the 60s..

Next week it seems we will be in a sweet spot Monday through Wednesday thanks to the large high in Northern New England that will eventually find its way into the Middle Atlantic States..

This strong high is going to keep our weather cool..

To the southwest we have what could be another tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico..

Teddy will be forced northward up the coast and well offshore our area..

Monday into Tuesday could turn out to be on the breezy side with Teddy going by to the east of us by about 600 miles..

However it seems that after coming close to Bermuda Sunday night into Monday, Teddy could be making a run for Nova Scotia on Tuesday as a very formidable hurricane..

There is still some model uncertainty with this as far as exact track and timing but we can say that Teddy will pass well to the east of us..

In fact the track of Teddy ultimately brings more dry air into the Eastern US and we may go all of next week without a drop of rain..

It has been a long time since we have experienced an outage of this magnitude,” said Thomas..

In the meantime, Mayrose said he has a generator to get by for now, “we’re fortunate to have that..

At least we can keep everything in the fridge cold and have some fans going.”.

But for those without a generator to help, for the time being, all they can do is wait for that moment of relief..

“We got our power back on an hour ago and everybody’s happy,” said Shindell..

Sally makes landfall, continues to drench Coast - Alabama Now.

PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — A newly strengthened Hurricane Sally made landfall near Gulf Shores about 5 a.m. Wednesday as a Category 2 storm..

Sally pummeled the Florida Panhandle and south Alabama with sideways rain, beach-covering storm surges, strong winds and power outages early Wednesday, moving toward shore at an agonizingly slow pace .

In the Panhandle’s Escambia County, Chief Sheriff’s Deputy Chip Simmons vowed to keep deputies out with residents as long as physically possible..

The county includes Pensacola, one of the largest cities on the Gulf Coast..

“The sheriff’s office will be there until we can no longer safely be out there, and then and only then will we pull our deputies in,” Simmons said at a storm briefing late Tuesday..

This for a storm that, during the weekend, appeared to be headed for New Orleans..

“Obviously this shows what we’ve known for a long time with storms – they are unpredictable,” Pensacola Mayor Grover Robinson IV said..

Hurricane Sally’s northern eyewall was raking the Gulf Coast with hurricane-force winds and rain from Pensacola Beach, Florida westward to Dauphin Island, Alabama, the National Hurricane Center said..

Forecasters say landfall came about 5 a.m. Wednesday when the center of the very slow moving hurricane crossed land near Gulf Shores as a Category 2..

Sally remains centered about 50 miles (75 kilometers) south-southeast of Mobile, Alabama and 40 miles (65 kilometers) southwest of Pensacola, Florida, with top winds of 105 mph (165 kmh), moving north.

Stacy Stewart, a senior specialist with the National Hurricane Center says the Category 2 hurricane could strengthen further before the entire eyewall moves inland..

The hurricane will bring “catastrophic and life threatening” rainfall over portions of the Gulf Coast, Florida panhandle and southeastern Alabama through Wednesday night, he said..

Stewart said the hazards associated with the hurricane are going to continue after it makes landfall, with the storm producing heavy rainfall Wednesday night and Thursday over portions of central and .

Up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain could fall in some spots, and “that would be record-setting in some locations,” Rappaport said in an interview Tuesday night..

Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Teddy has now become a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (160 kph) the National Hurricane Center said early Wednesday..

Teddy is located about 820 miles (1,335 km) east of the Lesser Antilles..

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (40 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (281 km)..

Some strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and Teddy is likely to become a major hurricane later Wednesday and could reach Category 4 strength on Thursday..

Hurricane Sally unleashes flooding along coast - Alabama Now.

PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — Hurricane Sally lumbered ashore near the Florida-Alabama line Wednesday with 105 mph (165) winds and rain measured in feet, not inches, swamping homes and trapping people in hig.

Moving at an agonizing 3 mph, or about as fast as a person can walk, the storm made landfall at 4:45 a.m. near Gulf Shores, Alabama, after battering for hours a stretch of coastline that includes Mobi.

Flash floods pushed water into homes in Alabama and Florida, and officials in Pensacola and surrounding Escambia County, with a combined population of about 320,000, urged residents to stick to text m.

More than 2 feet of rain (61 centimeters) was recorded near Naval Air Station Pensacola, and nearly 3 feet (1 meter) of water covered streets in downtown Pensacola, the National Weather Service report.

It was the second hurricane to hit the Gulf Coast in less than three weeks and the latest blow in one of the busiest hurricane seasons ever recorded, so frenetic that forecasters have nearly run throu.

At the start of the week, Sally was one of a record-tying five storms churning simultaneously in the Atlantic, strung out like charms on a bracelet..

Like the wildfires raging on the West Coast, the onslaught of hurricanes has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing slower, rainier, more powerful and more destructive st.

In Orange Beach, Alabama, winds blew out walls in one corner of a condominium building, exposing the interiors of condos on at least five floors, video posted online showed..

Other images showed buildings with roof damage and stranded boats shoved onshore by storm surge..

At least 50 people in Orange Beach were rescued from flooded homes and taken to shelters, Mayor Tony Kennon said..

“We got a few people that we just haven’t been able to get to because the water is so high,” Kennon said..

“But they are safe in their home, as soon as the water recedes, we will rescue them.”.

Street lights were knocked out in downtown Mobile, a city of about 190,000, where a stoplight snapped, swinging wildly on its cable..

Before sunrise, water was up to the doors of Jordan Muse’s car outside the Pensacola hotel where her family took shelter after fleeing their mobile home a few miles away..

Her 8-year-old son played with toys underneath the hotel room’s desk as Muse peered out the window, watching rain fly by in sheets..

Nearly a half-million homes and businesses had lost electricity by early Wednesday, according to the poweroutage.us site..

A curfew was imposed in Gulf Shores hours before the storm’s arrival..

In Escambia County, Chief Sheriff’s Deputy Chip Simmons vowed to keep deputies out helping residents as long as possible..

National Hurricane Center forecaster Stacy Stewart said the rain will be “catastrophic and life-threatening” over portions of the Gulf Coast..

He likened the storm’s plodding pace to that of Hurricane Harvey, which swamped Houston in 2017..

Sally’s effects were felt all along the northern Gulf Coast..

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Fox News Channel that Trump was in contact with the states’ governors and ready to help “in every way possible.”.

Sally unleashes flooding; hundreds rescued - Alabama Now.

PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — Hurricane Sally lumbered ashore near the Florida-Alabama line Wednesday with 105 mph (165 kph) winds and rain measured in feet, not inches, swamping homes and forcing the rescue.

Moving at just 3 mph (5 kph), or about as fast as a person can walk, the storm made landfall at 4:45 a.m. close to Gulf Shores, Alabama, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) from Pensacola, Florida..

It accelerated to a light jog as it battered the Pensacola and Mobile, Alabama, metropolitan areas encompassing nearly 1 million people..

It cast boats onto land or sank them at the dock, flattened palm trees, peeled away roofs, blew down signs and knocked out power to more than a 540,000 homes and businesses..

A replica of Christopher Columbus’ ship the Nina that had been docked at the Pensacola waterfront was missing, police said..

Sally tore loose a barge-mounted construction crane, which then smashed into the new Three Mile Bridge over Pensacola Bay, causing a section of the year-old span to collapse, authorities said..

The storm also ripped away a large section of a fishing pier at Alabama’s Gulf State Park on the very day a ribbon-cutting had been scheduled following a $2.4 million renovation..

By the afternoon, authorities in Escambia County, which includes Pensacola, said at least 377 people had been rescued from flooded areas..

More than 40 people trapped by high water were brought to safety within a single hour, including a family of four found in a tree, Sheriff David Morgan said..

Authorities in Pensacola said 200 National Guard members would arrive Thursday to help..

Curfews were announced in Escambia County and in some coastal Alabama towns..

Sally turned some Pensacola streets into white-capped rivers early Wednesday..

Sodden debris and flooded cars were left behind as the water receded..

By early afternoon, Sally had weakened into a tropical storm, with winds down to 70 mph (110 kph)..

Showers still fell in parts of the stricken area Wednesday evening, and the storm was expected to generate heavy rain farther inland as it moved over Alabama and into Georgia..

At least eight waterways in south Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were expected to hit their major flood levels by Thursday..

Some of the crests could break records, submerge bridges and flood some homes, the National Weather Service warned..

Morgan, the Escambia County sheriff, estimated thousands would need to flee rising waters in the coming days..

Escambia officials urged residents to rely on text messages for contacting family and friends to keep cellphone service open for 911 calls..

“There are entire communities that we’re going to have to evacuate,” the sheriff said..

“It’s going to be a tremendous operation over the next several days.”.

West of Pensacola, in Perdido Key, Florida, Joe Mirable arrived at his real estate business to find the two-story building shattered..

Digging through the ruins, Mirable pointed out a binder labeled “Hurricane Action Plan.”.

“I think the professionals got this one wrong,” he said before the wind blew away his hat..

More than 2 feet (61 centimeters) of rain was recorded near Naval Air Station Pensacola, and nearly 3 feet (1 meter) of water covered streets in downtown Pensacola, the National Weather Service report.

“It’s not common that you start measuring rainfall in feet,” said forecaster David Eversole..

Sally was the second hurricane to hit the Gulf Coast in less than three weeks and the latest blow in one of the busiest hurricane seasons ever..

Forecasters have nearly run through the alphabet of storm names with 2 1/2 months still to go..

At the start of the week, Sally was one of a record-tying five storms churning simultaneously in the Atlantic basin..

An emergency crew rescued two people on Dauphin Island, Alabama, after the hurricane ripped the roof off their home and the rest of the house began to crumble..

In Orange Beach, Alabama, the wind blew out the walls in one corner of a condominium building, exposing at least five floors..

At least 50 people were rescued from flooded homes and taken to shelters, Mayor Tony Kennon said..

As soon as the water recedes, we will rescue them.”.

Sally’s crawl made it hard to predict where it would strike..

Just two days before landfall, the storm was forecast to hit New Orleans — 140 miles (225 kilometers) west of where it came ashore..

So Robert Lambrisky and his husband were caught somewhat off guard when the hurricane shook their door before daybreak and forced rainwater inside their home in Sanders Beach near Pensacola..

“We had some warning, but this was just such a strange storm,” Lambrisky said..

“So all of this preparing that you do, when you know the storm is coming, was something we only half did because we were convinced the storm wasn’t going to hit us.”.

Sally’s effects were felt all along the northern Gulf Coast, affecting low-lying properties in Mississippi and southeastern Louisiana..

Meanwhile, far out in the Atlantic, Teddy became a hurricane Wednesday with winds of 100 mph (160 kph)..

Forecasters said it could reach Category 4 strength before closing in on Bermuda, which took a direct hit from Hurricane Paulette only days ago..

Videos posted to social media show East Main Street by the Holiday Inn Express turned into a river, and Mike Wood with PPD said floodwaters are beginning to creep up Palafox Street..

“I’m with The Weather Channel, they were set up at Palafox Pier but that's now flooding,” Wood said..

It’s nothing major yet, but there’s a lot of high winds and rain right now.”.

All bridges in the area are closed due to high sustained winds, including the Three Mile Bride, Garcon Point Bridge and Navarre Beach Causeway..

Sally’s path and landfall is eerily similar to Hurricane Ivan’s, which made landfall on the same day – Sept. 16 – in 2004, 16 years ago, in nearly the exact same place that Sally is projected to land..

Even after the eyewall passes, Pensacola is still slated to receive torrential amounts of rain as the system makes a very slow crawl to the north/northeast..

Tevin Wooten, an on-air meteorologist with The Weather Channel, compared Sally’s speed to that of a turtle as he battled the 2 mile per hour storm from Navarre..

Turtles crawl, or walk if you will, between 3 and 4 miles per hour,” he said..

“So Sally, quite literally, is moving at a turtle’s pace, if not slower.”.

Sally has been an unusual storm due in part to the uncertainty in her path and intensity..

She was originally forecast to make landfall near New Orleans, then Mississippi, then Mobile Bay, and now, finally, she’s partially come ashore near Gulf Shores and is expected to completely come asho.

Hurricane Sally: Pensacola Bay Bridge may be out of commission a month or more.

After a loose construction barge knocked a chunk of roadway out of the Pensacola Bay Bridge during Hurricane Sally, Florida Sen. Doug Broxson estimated the damage may take a month or more to repair..

The senator confirmed that during the storm, a crane passed under the bridge and smashed through the surface of the road from beneath..

The collision happened a day after a different construction barge owned by contractor Skanska USA had broken loose and struck a fishing pier before becoming lodged beneath the Pensacola Bay Bridge on .

The bridge was closed immediately and never reopened, before it was hit again sometime in the early morning hours Wednesday..

Broxson said the contractor made the decision not to move the equipment out of the area based on projections showing Hurricane Sally making landfall well west of Pensacola..

Instead, it landed near Gulf Shores, Alabama, leaving Pensacola on the devastating side of winds and rain..

Part of Three Mile Bridge is gone:Here's what we know  Where did the barges go?.

See where runaway barges from Three Mile Bridge have ended up  The barge was just one of several that broke loose..

Five washed up near downtown —four just west of the Missing Children's Memorial and one in front of the Gulf Power building — and a sixth was drifting toward the Escambia Bay and the Interstate 10 bri.

An seventh barge floated loose and wedged itself against the Garcon Point Bridge, forcing the bridge to remain closed until road crews can inspect it..

Santa Rosa County emergency management said the barge ran against the bridge at around 4 p.m. and was not secured or tethered to anything..

Skanska did not address queries regarding the number and location of its barges that had been dislodged by the storm..

"We are aware of the impact on the Pensacola Bay Bridge project stemming from the unforeseen effects of Hurricane Sally," an emailed statement from the company said..

"At this time, our main priority is the safety of our team members and the surrounding community..

We remain in close communication with local authorities and the Florida Department of Transportation, and will assess the full impact to the project in coordination with them once it is safe to do so..

Broxson said he, like his constituents, was still and shock and wrapping his head around the devastation caused by Hurricane Sally..

In the near term, he said the focus for him and the state would be helping ensure communities were safe and accessible..

"I think probably what we're prioritizing is trying to shore up our transportation and the infrastructure, making sure that people are safe, that they're not stranded," Broxson said Wednesday afternoo.

However, he noted that FEMA had traditionally worked with governments to ensure they had what they needed to recover..

Broxson said paperwork had already been sent to Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties to start the process of selecting contractors for debris removal..

He said in the beginning governments would likely be borrowing from themselves, but that FEMA had been reliable about reimbursing local disaster expenditures, even if it took awhile..

On a personal note, Broxson estimated he had received about five feet of flooding on his property, and said he had lost a boat, a dock and multiple vehicles..

Broxson said he and his family were safe, and at the moment he was mainly just in disbelief at how catastrophic Sally had been, especially considering it had been classified as a Category 2 hurricane..

"I think when you get the reports from the coastline between here and Navarre along the beach, every man-made structure is going to have to be replaced ... that's unprecedented," Broxson said..

"It will go down as an Ivan," Broxson said, referencing a devastating hurricane that ravaged Pensacola exactly 16 years prior..

"I think over the next few days when you see the damage it's done, this is going to shock you.".

Hurricane Sally moves ashore near Gulf Shores, Alabama, flooding rain continues - Magnolia State Live.

Hurricane Sally made landfall Wednesday near Gulf Shores, Alabama, as a Category 2 storm, pushing a surge of ocean water onto the coast and dumping torrential rain that forecasters said would cause da.

Moving at an agonizingly slow 3 mph, Sally finally came ashore at 4:45 a.m. local time with top winds of 105 mph (165 kmh), the National Hurricane Center said..

Sally’s northern eyewall had raked the Gulf Coast with hurricane-force winds and rain from Pensacola Beach, Florida, westward to Dauphin Island, Alabama, for hours before its center finally hit land..

Trees were bending over and flailing around in the howling winds in downtown Pensacola, where driving rain flooded streets up to the bumpers of parked cars..

In downtown Mobile, Alabama, a street light snapped, swinging wildly on its cable..

Nearly 400,000 homes and businesses had lost electricity by early Wednesday, according to the poweroutage.us site..

A curfew was called in Gulf Shores due to life-threatening conditions..

In the Panhandle’s Escambia County, Chief Sheriff’s Deputy Chip Simmons vowed to keep deputies out helping residents as long as physically possible..

Stacy Stewart, a senior specialist with the hurricane center, told The Associated Press said the rainfall will be “catastrophic and life-threatening” over portions of the Gulf Coast, Florida panhandle.

Sally was a rare storm that could make history, said Ed Rappaport, deputy director of the hurricane center..

“Sally has a characteristic that isn’t often seen and that’s a slow forward speed and that’s going to exacerbate the flooding,” Rappaport told the AP..

Sally’s impact was felt all along the northern Gulf Coast..

In Orange Beach, Alabama, Chris Parks, a tourist from Nashua, New Hampshire, spent the night monitoring the storm and taking care of his infant child as strong winds battered his family’s hotel room..

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves urged people in the southern part of his state to prepare for flash flooding..

As Sally’s outer bands reached the Gulf Coast, the manager of an alligator ranch in Moss Point, Mississippi, was hoping he wouldn’t see a repeat of what happened at the gator farm in 2005, when about .

Gulf Coast Gator Ranch & Tours Manager Tim Parker says Sally has been a stressful storm because forecasters were predicting a storm surge of as much as 9 feet in his area..

He felt some relief after surge predictions shifted..

Sally was forecast to bring heavy downpours to parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas later in the week..

Some inland residents weren’t waiting, driving to the coast to experience Sally’s power before it hit land..

Why Hurricane Sally's slow movement makes it more dangerous over Gulf Coast.

Heather Bordeaux and Mike Bordeaux look out at a flooded street in front of their hotel as Hurricane Sally passes through the area on September 16, 2020 in Pensacola, Florida..

Sally comes as the West Coast battles historic wildfires made worse by human-caused climate change..

The blazes have wiped out entire communities in Oregon and Washington state, decimated a record number of acres in California and caused some of the globe's worst air quality..

The storm's incredibly slow pace, which at times was just 3 miles per hour, and its stalling over the Gulf represent a climate change effect that's triggered more destructive and frequent storms..

Slower storms unleash more rain and long-lasting winds..

As of Wednesday morning, Sally was heading northeast at about 5 mph..

Hurricane Sally stalled over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall early Wednesday , bringing heavy rain to coastal communities in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana..

Satellite image of Hurricane Sally making landfall along the Gulf coast of the US on Sept 16th, 2020..

The speed of tropical storms making landfall has slowed during the last several decades..

The lingering creates worse rainfall and flooding..

North Atlantic hurricanes specifically have been moving slower and stalling more frequently over the past seven decades, according to research by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administ.

Other research suggests that warming in the Arctic has weakened atmospheric circulation, which is likely affecting hurricane speed by causing a slowing of the jet stream..

"Our own work suggests that climate change is favoring precisely such jet stream behavior," said Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State and an author of the report..

Sally's stalling is comparable to Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which flooded parts of Houston with 60 inches of rainfall after it stalled and was downgraded to a tropical storm..

In 2018, Hurricane Florence also stalled over North Carolina's coast..

And in 2019, Hurricane Dorian caused massive destruction and at least 70 deaths when it lingered over the Bahamas for more than a day..

Research also shows that global warming has intensified extreme rainstorms in the U.S. and other parts of the world..

"Rainstorms are getting measurably more intense as a result of global warming..

Sally's rains will be devastating," Climate scientist Eric Holthaus wrote in a tweet. ".

"  The U.S. is experiencing its worst hurricane season on record, with 20 named storms so far..

Forecasters have nearly run through the alphabet of names for storms this season..

Behind Sally, several more storms are developing in the Atlantic Ocean..

Scientists also say that climate change has made the hurricane season more dangerous by triggering more rapidly intensifying storms..

For instance, Hurricane Laura, the fastest-intensifying hurricane ever in the Gulf of Mexico, devastated parts of Louisiana and Texas last month, leaving at least 15 people dead..

"What is more concerning is the recent trend in hurricanes rapidly intensifying to become much stronger right up until the time of landfall in the Gulf of Mexico," said Ryan Maue, who runs the website.

"Previous decades saw the opposite almost as a rule: storms moving toward the coast would weaken prior to landfall.".

Powerful, drenching Sally makes landfall as Category 2 hurricane, batters Gulf Coast: 'It's just a nightmare'.

Sally made landfall before dawn in Gulf Shores, Alabama, about 30 miles from the Florida line..

Meandering inland at 3 mph, the storm toppled trees and power lines, battered homes and businesses..

Flooding from its unrelenting rains turned streets into rivers, sweeping up cars and washing out bridges..

More than 550,000 homes and businesses were without power in Alabama, Florida and Louisiana..

Those numbers were likely to rise as Sally moved deeper inland..

Sally picked up a bit of speed as it rolled over land at 5 mph Wednesday afternoon..

Sally was forecast through Wednesday to produce additional rainfall totals of 8 to 12 inches with localized higher amounts possible along the central Gulf Coast from west of Tallahassee, Florida, to M.

The storm was expected to move inland across southeastern Alabama on Wednesday night, dumping "life-threatening" rainfall over portions of the Gulf Coast, Florida Panhandle and southeastern Alabama..

A tornado watch was issued for parts of Alabama, Florida and Georgia until Wednesday evening..

Rain totals of 10 to 20 inches are likely but could balloon to 35 inches in some areas..

Heavy rainfall was forecast into Thursday over portions of central and southern Georgia, the weather service said..

“It’s not common that you start measuring rainfall in feet,” said weather service forecaster David Eversole in Mobile, Alabama..

“It just keeps pounding and pounding and pounding the area with tropical rain and just powerful winds..

Sally could produce up to 7 feet of storm surge across Alabama's coastline from the Mississippi border to the Florida border, forecasters said..

The storm could dump up to a foot of rain along pockets of southeastern Mississippi, southern and central Alabama, northern Georgia and the western Carolinas..

Sally is forecast to turn northeastward and move across the Southeast through Friday..

Southern and central Alabama to central Georgia could see 4 to 8 inches of rain and isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches..

"Significant flash and urban flooding is likely, as well as widespread minor to moderate flooding on some rivers," the weather service said..

Western South Carolina into western and central North Carolina can expect up to 4 to 6 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 9 inches..

Southeast Virginia could get 2 to 5 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 7 inches..

Sally was the eighth named storm to make landfall in the continental USA this year – the most through Sept. 16 in recorded history, surpassing the seven storms of 1916, Colorado State University meteo.

Climate change is making hurricanes more dangerous, scientists say.

FORT MYERS, Fla. – Scientists warn a warming climate is making hurricanes more dangerous..

Lorraine Vismara lives along the water in downtown Fort Myers..

“It’s the reason to be in Florida and to have this is stupendous,” Vismara said..

She knows what bad storms can mean for a flood prone area..

“It’s coming up over and you go oh where do I walk,” Vismara said..

Tropical systems get their power from sea surface temperatures..

Florida Gulf Coast University’s Dr. Jo Muller said a warming climate means warmer water..

“The water is very warm, warmer than average, but it’s also very deep and warm,” Muller said..

She said a recent trend is that tropical storms have slowed down their forward moving speed..

“It means they can spend more time building up storm surge, spend more time getting stronger, and they also will drop a lot more precipitation,” Muller said..

Like we’ve seen this season with Hurricanes Sally and Laura, storms are more rapidly intensifying..

“You can go to sleep at night and you’ve got a category 1 hurricane and you wake up and it’s a category 3..

While Muller said this warming trend will likely only get worse, Vismara said the threat of more dangerous and costly storms won’t scare her off..

“It’s the price you pay and I’m not running away,” Vismara said..

According to Muller, while individual actions to reduce your carbon footprint help, it really comes down to voting for leaders who make that a priority..

Hurricane Sally’s Fierce Rain Shows How Climate Change Raises Storm Risks.

As hurricanes go, Sally was not especially powerful..

Rated a Category 2 storm when it struck the Gulf Coast on Wednesday, it was soon downgraded..

But climate change likely made it more dangerous by slowing it down and feeding it more moisture, setting it up to pummel the region with wind and catastrophic rainfall..

Sally was crawling at about 3 miles per hour when its eye made landfall early Wednesday near Gulf Shores, Ala., and was “inching its way inland” later in the day, the National Hurricane Center said..

The slow movement, or stalling, of the storm led to staggering rain totals, with more than two feet in some areas by midmorning Wednesday and widespread flooding..

“When a storm moves slower, it lingers longer over the same location,” said Kimberly Wood, a geoscientist at Mississippi State University..

“A rain rate of, say, an inch an hour — that’s not so bad if the rain only lasts 30 minutes..

But if it lasts for half a day, that adds up quickly.”.

Sally was not an isolated example of a stalling hurricane..

“There is increasing evidence that storms are slowing down,” Dr. Wood said..

'It definitely keeps you going': Jim Cantore shares memories as he covers Sally — his 104th storm.

You might think the Grim Reaper wears a dark, hooded cloak and carries a scythe..

But he actually wears khakis, a blue rain jacket and a baseball cap while holding onto a microphone..

"It's kind of weird the way the whole thing has grown where I'm kind of the Grim Reaper," Cantore told the USA TODAY Network on Tuesday..

Hurricane Sally, which made landfall early Wednesday off the Alabama coast, is the 104th storm in the books for Cantore..

That's almost 30 years of chasing storms — and people, who know to get out of town the moment he arrives..

"When it's all said and done, one of my most favorite parts of my job will continue to be how many great memories I've made meeting people out in the field, and I mean, there's just too many accounts,.

He's taken selfies with passers-by and loves to sign memorabilia, like a baseball bat and ball..

COVID-19 has proven to be a challenge for the man who loves to wrap his arms around his fans and goof off, he said..

The 2005 hurricane season saw 28 named storms, four of which — Emily, Katrina, Rita and Wilma — became Category 5 storms that made landfall in the United States, according to the National Weather Serv.

Six storms required names from the Greek alphabet..

So far in 2020, 20 storm names have been used and it's only the middle of September..

One more storm name, Wilfred, is left before it goes into the Greek alphabet..

"So it's like, oh my God, we still got two months and 15 days left of the hurricane season left.".

Hurricane Katrina  The 2005 hurricane season is where Cantore's most memorable hurricane lies in history — Hurricane Katrina..

"That one I will remember the most because we were at the Armed Forces retirement home," Cantore said..

"It went from being on camera and 10 minutes later helping the Navy Seabee Unit that was there on hand, to bringing all of our beds upstairs onto the second floor because the water was coming into the.

"  Katrina is ingrained in Cantore's memory — but other storms don't have the same privilege..

Not because they're not important, but because Cantore has covered so many that he doesn't remember them all..

I didn't write down everywhere I was for every storm, but I just knew I was in it ..." Cantore said. ".

Andrew was the first one, I was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, for that..

Flora-Bama beach bar still standing despite damaging floods after Sally slammed Gulf Coast.

Not even wet and windy Hurricane Sally was able to blow away the Flora-Bama..

The "most famous beach bar in the country" is still standing, the Flora-Bama posted on its Facebook page on Wednesday..

Here's what they said on Facebook:  "Not a lot of insight to how extensive the damage is but flooding is much worse than anticipated..

Flora-Bama stills stands... our properties across the street (Flora-Bama Marina, Ole River Grill and Yacht Club) are still standing as well but have been taking on some pretty damaging flood waters ov.

"  A photo and caption posted by the United Cajun Navy on Wednesday morning at 5:23 a.m. CT shows no visible damage to its roof or its walls, but shows rising water surrounding the bar..

A video from Live Storms Media shows storm surge surrounding the Flora-Bama..

Hurricane Sally made landfall Wednesday morning near Gulf Shores, Alabama, as a Category 2 storm..

A video from the Flora-Bama Marina shows thick bands and high gusts moving toward the area..

The bar originally said it would remain closed through Wednesday or Thursday, but the recent flooding damage might delay the opening..

Updates will come on the Flora-Bama's Facebook page as they become available..

"Please continue to pray for us, our friends, our families and our community as this storm moves out and we take on the backside winds and rain," the Facebook post said..

"We’ll be back with updates when we can but until then, everyone stay safe.".

The bar previously posted its preparations for Hurricane Sally earlier this week: "Hurricane preparation (check), sand bags out (check), Bushwackers flowin' (check).".

"Stay tuned to our Facebook page for all updates on business operations over the next 48hrs..

When the bridges temporarily close, the Flora-Bama will have to temporarily close (wave)..

Until then, we’ll leave the lights on for ya... everyone stay safe and we’ll keep you posted from here #ontheline"  See the photos:Areas of Pensacola Beach flood as Hurricane Sally rolls in  Hurricane.

The Gulf Coast landmark sits in both Escambia County, Florida, and Baldwin County, Alabama..

Hurricane Ivan in September 2004 caused major damage to the Flora-Bama, destroying and heavily damaging sections of the bar, causing the bar to shut down for a few days for the first time in over 40 y.

In 2010, the bar was reconstructed and elevated to withstand storms..

Gulf Power: 92% of Escambia County without power, 53% of Santa Rosa after Hurricane Sally.

Nearly 79% of the 252,368 households living in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties were still without power Thursday morning, a day after hurricane force winds and torrential rain hammered the Panhandle..

Gulf Power provides the majority of power for eight Florida Panhandle counties..

But residents in Escambia County and Santa Rosa County were by far the hardest hit by the outages caused by Hurricane Sally, according to Gulf Power spokeswoman Kimberly Blair..

Dig in:Power outage map  At 6 a.m. Thursday, roughly 92% of all households in Escambia County were without power, with a total of 149,956 confirmed outages among 161,522 customers..

In Santa Rosa County, about 47,708 households out of a total of 90,846 customers did not have power as of 6 a.m. Thursday - 53%..

“We have our Gulf Power crews that are also being assisted by our Florida Power and Light sister crews, who are here,” Blair said..

“We are committed to our primary goal, which is to restore customer’s power as quickly as it is safe to do so.”.

Gulf Power crews had to stop work in the early hours of Wednesday morning due to the worsening of the already hazardous weather conditions created by Hurricane Sally..

“They worked to restore power yesterday and through the night until conditions really deteriorated, and as soon as the weather allows them to get out and work safely, they will get out and start resto.

It remained uncertain Wednesday morning when crews would be able to start their work again..

More:Florida disaster relief: How to help Hurricane Sally victims  “We know that it's not fun to be without power,” Blair said..

“So, we will be working as fast as we can, as soon as we are able to, to get everyone’s power back on.”.

Gulf Power representatives were unable to say exactly what was causing the specific outages in specific areas that have been effected by the storm..

Without an immediate ability for power crews to get out into the field and start repairs, Gulf Power became temporarily hampered by a lack of on-the-ground information about the cause behind specific .

As soon as our crews go out to restore power, we also have people working simultaneously on accessing what is damaged, what needs to be restored: Is it a downed wire?.

Is it a downed tree limb on a wire that needs to be removed,” Blair said..

There also remains a strong possibility that Gulf Power’s underground infrastructure will need repairs as well as its open-air power lines..

“There are also some underground resources,” Blair explained..

There is a lot of that type of assessment going on, in trying to understand what needs to be restored..

“But,” she continued, “I think it’s fair to say that, historically tree limbs and downed trees do cause quite a bit of our outages.”.

PENSACOLA, Fla. — Downtown Pensacola, just to the east of where Hurricane Sally made landfall early Wednesday, was among the hardest-hit coastal areas, with residents waking up to streets that had bec.

Steven Gray, a professional photographer who lives in the Long Hollow neighborhood, went to bed, like most, expecting that the city would be spared any serious impacts..

“I honestly didn’t expect that we’d get the eye of the storm so close to us,” Gray said..

“I heard midday yesterday it was going to hit Biloxi..

Then, last night, I heard it was taking a hard turn east.”.

He was awakened when his building lost power about 4 a.m. and walked to the front door to investigate..

Gray’s home is built into a hillside, about 10 feet above the street beneath..

Peering out the window and down the block, he could see cars submerged and power lines downed..

About two blocks away, Gray’s ex-wife, Annie, was receiving a much ruder awakening..

She had moved into her apartment, in a lower-lying area, just two months before and had just finished furnishing it the prior week..

“I woke up in about a foot and a half of water,” she said..

“Water was bubbling up through my kitchen floor and rushing in under the front door.”.

She dialed 911 but could not get through to anyone..

Steven waded into the deluge in an attempt to rescue Annie and her six-month old kitten, Fitz, before being forced back by rising floodwater..

“When I started to wade across, it got neck deep pretty quickly,” he said..

By the time Steven was forced to turn back, the weight of the water kept Annie from opening her front door..

She grabbed Fitz, crawled out a window and took refuge in an upstairs neighbor's apartment while the storm raged..

By 9:30 a.m. the water was starting to recede, and it was clear that the damage was catastrophic..

At a midmorning news conference, Escambia County officials said emergency rescue teams had been deployed across the county..

Boat teams from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Coast Guard, along with civilian volunteers, were en route to help with the rescue operations..

10:32 a.m.: 'Dark, noisy' Gulf Shores official's account of riding out the hurricane  Sixteen years to the day after Hurricane Ivan caused “catastrophic” damage to Gulf Shores, Hurricane Sally appeare.

As of 9:30 a.m., Gulf Shores city officials had not received reports of fatalities or major medical conditions..

Sally’s landfall was officially clocked at 4:45 a.m. in Gulf Shores, but Grant Brown, the city’s public information officer, said conditions worsened around 3 a.m. and continued at their peak for near.

It was dark, noisy, and the windows were shaking.”.

The city is experiencing flooding in two major areas as the back end of the storm makes its way over Alabama’s coast..

Brown said the recent Hurricane Laura heavily impacted the dune structure along the coast line..

“You can imagine with wet soil conditions and high winds, we have a significant tree problem..

We have trees down over roadways, on people's homes..

We have significant flooding conditions in two different areas,” Brown said..

“Hurricane Laura reduced our primary dune structure..

Now, with the storm surge plus all of the water, the backside of the storm is pushing water back up on our beaches again..

The dune system in numerous locations has failed because of a lack of sand, so water is now pushed from the Gulf up into the roadways, under condominiums and beach houses..

We've heard of minor structural damage to the buildings, as you would expect.”.

More flooding is happening inland from the beach: The Intracoastal Waterway, which Brown said typically serves to help drain water away from the city’s residential neighborhoods, is at the highest lev.

The waterway is pushing water back into the neighborhoods, Brown said, the majority of which have lost power..

In hindsight, Brown said, officials think a mandatory evacuation order in low-lying areas might have been needed..

City and state officials strongly recommended evacuation from flood-prone areas early this week, but Gulf Shores emergency officials received multiple calls for high-water rescues in the height of the.

Brown said authorities waited for the eye to pass over, giving a brief respite in weather conditions, before making “more than 10” high-water rescues, some of which included multiple people..

“We continually said this was going to be a historic flooding event, water will be in places that you've never seen before,” Brown said..

“The good news it was rain water, so it wasn't as deadly of a storm surge..

… When you do mandatory evacuations you get people’s attention a little quicker..

Every time we have an event like this, we take notes during and after so we can go back and change best practices.”.

The city is optimistic about making a full recovery, Brown said..

“We've been down this road, unfortunately, a bunch of times,” he said..

“Our city has a very strong and healthy budget and reserve fund, so we will be able to survive and clean up and help our residents get back to their normal daily lives.”.

Hurricane Sally hit exactly 16 years after Ivan, even making landfall at the same spot.

PENSACOLA, Fla. – Longtime residents of the Panhandle and south Alabama couldn't help but note the date when Hurricane Sally made landfall at 4:45 this morning in Gulf Shores, Alabama..

It was 16 years to the day when Hurricane Ivan, a Category 3 storm, made landfall in nearly the exact spot..

And at nearly the same time of day — 2:50 a.m.  Ivan caused more than $27 billion in damage in the United States..

Much of the damage might sound familiar to those paying attention to Sally's path of wreckage..

Ivan took out power and phone lines, and an area between Orange Beach and Atmore received 10-15 inches of rain..

The damage wrought by Hurricane Ivan  On Sept. 16, 2004, Ivan hammered the Gulf Coast with 120 mph winds..

By the time it had dissipated, Ivan was responsible for 57 deaths in the United States and another 67 in other countries, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information..

Ivan's waves and 10-15 feet of storm surge severely damaged parts of the I-10 bridge system over Pensacola Bay..

In an after-season report, the National Hurricane Center said as much as a quarter-mile of the bridge collapsed into the bay..

For those who lived through it, Ivan was nothing short of harrowing..

Pensacola News-Journal reporter Kimberly Blair wrote in an email that Ivan was the stuff of nightmares: "We tried to flee again..

The wind must have been blowing about 70 or 80 mph..

A huge pine tree was lying across the front on my house..

We all held on to each other and waded out to the cars in the driveway..

"  It reduced some neighborhoods to rubble in Pensacola..

But neighbor helped neighbor and the city rebuilt..

Ivan was also a power source for tornadoes, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information..

An outbreak of 117 tornadoes occurred across nine states as a result of Ivan's trip through the United States..

At one point more than 1.8 million people were without electricity across nine states..

The remarkable track of Hurricane Ivan  Hurricane Ivan's path was likely one of the most remarkable in weather history..

It was at one point a Category 5, and it actually made two landfalls in the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center's report on the storm..

After forming off the coast of Africa on Aug. 31, Ivan gathered steam quickly, becoming first a Category 4 by Sept. 3..

It then became a Category 5 as it moved through the Caribbean Sea, causing massive damage to Grenada and the Canary Islands..

Once Ivan had hit the Gulf coast, and after moving through the southern U.S. and exiting around the Delmarva peninsula, it made a second trip into the U.S..

According to the National Hurricane Center's report, after becoming an extratropical low, Ivan moved south, crossed southern Florida back into the Gulf, and on Sept. 22, had reformed into a tropical d.

It continued to gain strength, becoming a tropical storm once more, and made landfall in southwest Louisiana on Sept. 24 as a tropical depression before finally disbanding over Texas..

Ivan existed for 22½ days and produced a track more than 5600 miles long, according to a report made by the National Hurricane Center..

Weather 60% Go for Thursday Starlink Launch from FL.

Photo Credit: Jeff Seibert / AmericaSpace  SpaceX aims to launch a flight-proven Falcon 9 core for the third time in a single calendar year as early as Thursday, as it seeks to deliver another 60-stro.

Liftoff of the history-making B1058 core—which first saw service to loft the Demo-2 flight of Crew Dragon and kick off “Bob and Doug’s Excellent Adventure” on 30 May, then launched South Korea’s ANASI.

If it flies on time, B1058 will clock its third launch in just 110 days and will become the fourth Falcon 9 to have logged as many as three missions in 2020..

Video Credit: AmericaSpace  A successful launch on Thursday will mark SpaceX’s 17th flight of the year, setting 2020 in third place for the highest number of Falcon 9 missions, topped only by the 18 l.

And this most unfortunate of years has seen all but two missions flown on previously-used Falcon 9s, including the first-ever fifth and sixth flights by an orbital-class rocket..

Ten batches of Starlinks have flown, together with a powerful Global Positioning System (GPS) Block III navigation and timing satellite for the U.S. Space Force, Argentina’s SAOCOM-1B Earth-imaging pl.

Eleven returning cores have alighted on the deck of the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS), whilst two have done likewise on Landing Zone (LZ)-1 at the Cape..

B1058 rises on 30 May for its maiden voyage, carrying Dragon Endeavour crewmen Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the International Space Station (ISS)..

The B1058 core may make its third flight as soon as Thursday..

Photo Credit: Mike Killian/AmericaSpace  In readiness for Thursday’s opening launch attempt, the ASDS “Just Read the Instructions” put to sea last Sunday, bound for a position about 390 miles (630 km).

Having previously supported seven successful Falcon 9 landings off the West Coast between January 2017 and January 2019—including the first and last Iridium NEXT missions—JRTI began the long journey t.

It scored its first Falcon 9 “catch” in the Atlantic Ocean in June 2020 and has since repeated this feat by similarly snaring B1060 as it wrapped up its first flight later that same month..

But waiting in the wings with an ever-present danger is Hurricane Sally, which first arose over the Bahamas last week and was officially designated a tropical depression on 11 September..

Shortly after making landfall near Miami, it strengthened into a tropical storm and over the following days rapidly intensified to hurricane strength, firstly to Category 1 and by the evening of the 1.

And despite being temporarily weakened on Tuesday by increased windshear and upwelling, it re-intensified on Tuesday, with sustained winds around 80 mph (130 km/h)..

Sally currently resides to the southwest of Pensacola, progressing slowly northwards..

Blackened and scorched from one previous high-energy launch and re-entry, B1058 stands ready for its ANASIS-II mission in July..

Photo Credit: John Studwell/AmericaSpace  Its presence has produced a 60-percent outlook for favorable weather on Thursday, with a marked deterioration to just 40-percent in the event of a 24-hour scr.

“Hurricane Sally will continue to influence the weather across the Spaceport for the week,” noted the 45th Weather Squadron at Patrick Air Force Base in its L-2 briefing, issued Tuesday..

It was stressed that the hurricane is expected to progress eastwards and make its way through the Deep South of the United States..

“The influence of the system will keep south-southeasterly winds in place, limiting shower and storm chances through mid-week across the Spaceport and keeping most activity inland,” the 45th added..

“By Thursday, winds will become more southwesterly across Central Florida as the remnants of Sally are expected to merge with a frontal system..

This will delay the development of the east coast sea breeze and push activity from west to east across the state, increasing the chances for afternoon and evening showers and thunderstorms.”.

B1058 springs away from Space Launch Complex (SLC)-40 on 20 July, bearing ANASIS-II to orbit..

And as her remnants move into Florida on Friday, they will bring a return of tropical moisture and an elevated likelihood of inclement weather with additional thick cloud cover..

Elsewhere, on Space Launch Complex (SLC)-37B at the Cape, a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta IV Heavy is targeting No Earlier Than (NET) 26 September for its long-delayed NROL-44 mission on behalf o.

Postponed since 29 August by a stuck pad-side regulator, it was initially noted by ULA that a minimum of one week was necessary to reconfigure the triple-barreled booster for another attempt..

NROL-44 had already had its launch date shifted from June to August, for reasons which remain unclear, before suffering two scrubbed attempts to get airborne late last month..

Postponed 24 hours past its original 26 August target, at the NRO’s request, an attempt on the 27th was itself moved two days to the right in response to a power redundancy issue in a critical ground-.

In the pre-dawn darkness of Saturday 29th, a heater issue during the countdown was resolved by the sterling work of the anomaly team, led by Anomaly Chief Dave McFarland, but launch was ultimately abo.

The Delta IV Heavy’s starboard-side Common Booster Core (CBC) had ignited as planned, but the requisite start conditions were not met to proceed with the ignition of the core booster..

It was a dramatic sight, as the Delta IV Heavy’s characteristic “fireball”, triggered by the highly visible burning-off of residual hydrogen under the engines, flared and died and a pall of ashen-gray.

In the minutes after the abort, safety systems whirred into action as fire detectors verified that the pad was safe and efforts to “de-tank” the Delta IV Heavy of its 440,000 pounds (200,000 kg) of li.

The cold light of day dawns on the grounded Delta IV Heavy, following the 29 August abort..

Launch of NROL-44 is now targeted for no sooner than 26 September..

“Additional testing allowed us to isolate the failure to the regulator..

Upon internal inspection, a tear in the diaphragm was verified to be the root cause.”.

NROL-44 will be the 12th flight of the gargantuan Delta IV Heavy..

Photo Credit: ULA  She confirmed that all three regulators—one for each Common Booster Core (CBC)—are currently in the process of being inspected and re-tested..

Earlier this week, Mr. Bruno noted that “to be safe”, ULA was opting to replace all three regulators, necessitating an additional delay and a new NET of 26 September..

It remains to be seen how the shifting sands of the Cape’s launch manifest will affect other downstream missions..

SpaceX tentatively had another Starlink flight targeted for launch before month’s end, which looks likely to slip into October..

It is expected to fly atop the veteran B1051 core, making its record-tying sixth launch..

And a brand-new core is also slated to deliver the fourth GPS Block III satellite to Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), possibly as soon as the evening of 30 September..

FIRST ALERT: Remnants of Sally may bring small tornado threat.

MYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) - The remnants of Hurricane Sally will pass through the Carolinas late Thursday and may bring the risk of isolated tornadoes to some areas..

A few isolated severe storms and tornadoes will be possible on Thursday..

(WMBF)  A level two severe weather risk in now in place..

A few tornadoes and damaging wind gusts associated with Sally will exist from Georgia into the eastern Carolinas from midday through the late afternoon and evening hours Thursday..

Strong low to mid-level winds in the atmosphere will persist with the remnants of Sally as it spreads from Georgia and into the Carolinas during the day on Thursday..

This will result in an atmosphere favorable for strong to severe storms capable of producing gusty winds and an isolated tornado threat..

Tropical humidity increasing across the area will add fuel to the atmosphere and help to energize any developing thunderstorms..

(WMBF)  The most likely time frame for severe storms and isolated tornadoes will be from the midday hours into the early evening on Thursday..

Sally weakens to a tropical depression as it moves inland.

As of 11 p.m. Wednesday, Sally has weakened to a tropical depression..

Sally made landfall around 5:45 a.m. as a Category 2 hurricane Wednesday with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph and a minimum central pressure of 965 mb..

The eye of the hurricane was near Gulf Shores, Alabama, at landfall..

Catastrophic flooding is still ongoing in portions of the north-central Gulf Coast, even though Sally has moved inland..

Right now, Tropical Depression Sally has maximum sustained winds of 35 mph..

Thankfully, it is also moving a little faster, now to the northeast at 9 mph..

Although Sally has weakened, the storm is going to bring additional rainfall totals of 5″- 8″ in spots of eastern Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas as it continues to move to the northeast..

Sally should dissipate to a remnant low by late morning Friday..

As Sally continues to move inland, our weather will continue to improve in Southwest Florida!.

As we saw on Wednesday, expect more sunshine again on Thursday with only isolated storms in the forecast..

A few showers may be possible in the morning, however, driven by the broader steering currents produced by Sally..

Elsewhere in the tropics we have Tropical Storm Vicky, Hurricane Teddy, and a couple of areas of disturbed weather with medium chances of development (there’s another area of disturbed weather far in .

Vicky nor Teddy will pose any threat to SW Florida..

Teddy may, however, move over Bermuda as a hurricane early next week, after they already had a direct hit from Hurricane Paulette earlier this week!.

The Northeast US coast will need to keep an eye on where Teddy goes after that..

Closer to home, there is a broad area of low pressure in the southwest Gulf of Mexico that has a 70% chance of development..

There is a high amount of uncertainty regarding where this system will go, but everyone along the Gulf Coast needs to monitor this system..

The other disturbance is a couple hundred miles south of the Cape Verde islands..

This one has a 60% chance of development as it moves westward over the next 3-5 days..

This is another system we will need to keep track of, as it is too soon to know whether or not it will impact the United States..

Wilfred is the next — and last — name on the list..

After that, any named storms will need to use the Greek Alphabet!.

Missouri Task Force 1 staged near Lake Pontchartrain ahead of Hurricane Sally.

SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (KY3) - Missouri Task Force 1 is currently staged just northwest of Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana as Hurricane Sally makes landfall..

Gale Blomenkamp is a member of Missouri Task Force 1 and the Assistant Fire Chief with the Boone County Fire Protection District..

While Blomenkamp was not part of the deployed team this time around, he shed some light on what their day-to-day routine could look like..

“We will remain in staging until we get a mission assignment from the incident management team down there,” began Blomenkamp..

“Once that occurs, that could be water rescues, it could be searching neighborhoods, it could be a wide-area search, it could be a myriad of different assignments.”.

Blomenkamp also said one of the toughest parts of the job is the dangers of being in an unfamiliar area, adding that a neighborhood or city can look vastly different when flooded..

Forecasters along the Gulf Coast expect a storm surge of up to 11 feet in some areas..

One of the many reasons the Type 3 team is made up of 46 personnel with an emphasis in water rescue capabilities..

#motf1 Missouri Task Force 1 has been activated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency ahead of Tropical Storm... Posted by Boone County Fire Protection District on Sunday, September 13, 2020  Mis.

While Blomenkamp says it’s rare for the crew to be gone for the entirety of that time, he said it’s possible this time because of how slow Hurricane Sally is moving..

He thanked the employers and families who allow task members to take the trip..

“For an employer to let someone go for 14 days, or maybe for a family to go without their loved one for 14 days and manage a household by themselves, or whatever that may be, it’s a big toll on everyo.

“Without the support of employers and the families this would not be possible.”.

A Facebook post from the Boone County Fire Protection District Monday afternoon also revealed there are Missouri Task Force 1 personnel also deployed in Oregon as wildfires ravage the west coast..

The post stated the team is, “engaged with managing US&R resources and assisting other management teams assigned.”.

#motf1 Missouri Task Force 1 has arrived in Hammond, LA, located just northwest of Lake Pontchartrain..

The type 3 task... Posted by Boone County Fire Protection District on Monday, September 14, 2020  Blomenkamp said he is incredibly proud of all those helping across the nation..

“These are the best of the best trained people in Missouri, we’re very proud of men and women who chose to do this.”.

As of Wednesday afternoon, Jefferson Street, Main Street, and everything from Barrancas Avenue to Tarragona Street was still underwater..

Wood was embedded with Jim Cantore, star meteorologist with The Weather Channel, and Cantore's TV crew all night Tuesday and into the early morning hours Wednesday in downtown..

Wood said even Cantore was surprised by the wrath Sally unleashed on Pensacola..

“I asked him, I said, ‘this hurricane caught us off guard,’ and he said, ‘me too,’” Wood said..

“For a guy like that to say something like that, it was kind of cool coming from him.”.

Section of Pensacola Bay Bridge collapses during Hurricane Sally.

Hurricane Sally has knocked out a section of Pensacola’s new Three Mile Bridge, according to the Escambia County sheriff..

Camera views from the Florida Department of Transportation show a chunk of the bridge has disappeared..

The Pensacola News Journal reports that a crane collapsed onto the bridge, and Tuesday, the newspaper reported a barge got loose and hit the bridge, which connects Pensacola to Gulf Breeze..

At a news conference, Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan confirmed that part of the new bridge had come off amid the storm..

Rainfall totals may not be certain at this point in time, but what does appear certain are the cooler temperatures to follow..

In fact the European model is showing temperatures as low as 39 next Tuesday morning!.

This would mean a first frost for many locations around WNC in the higher elevations..

Alaqua Animal Refuge evacuates animals after flooding.

WALTON COUNTY, Fla. (WJHG) - A local animal refuge had to make an emergency evacuation Tuesday after rain from Hurricane Sally flooded the property..

Alaqua Animal Refuge representatives say they called the foster community and within hours the most vulnerable animals were picked up and taken to safer locations..

They say Wednesday morning, leaders of Alaqua were able to assess the damage..

They say some areas on the property are flooded with water two to three feet deep and they had to use a boat to get to the refuge..

Alaqua Animal Refuge leaders say the water is as deep as two to three feet in some areas of the property..

An opossum climbs a fence at Alqua Animal Refuge to get away from the high waters..

(Alaqua Animal Refuge)  At this time, Alaqua leaders say there’s nothing they can do but wait for the water to subside so they can start the clean up process..

“We are so looking forward to the day when we will not have to deal with weather events and flooding such as this,” Alaqua Founder Laurie Hood said..

“It is one of the main reasons we have been trying to move from this location for many years..

And luckily, our move to our future home is near and is even more critical as its location is high and dry and evacuations such as this will no longer be necessary.”.

The current location of Alaqua is about 200 yards from the Choctawhatchee Bay, according to the representatives..

Alaqua Animal Refuge is a no-kill animal shelter in Walton County..

The refuge received heavy rainfall from Hurricane Sally, causing flooding and animal evacuations..

ACFR crews deployed to Panhandle for hurricane response.

An Alachua County Fire Rescue crew left for the Florida Panhandle Wednesday evening to assist with the response to Hurricane Sally, which took a late eastward turn and punched the Pensacola area hard..

Chief Harold Theus said an inland strike team with six staffers from ACFR along with personnel from Clay, St. Johns and Marion counties will be helping with medical cases..

Theus said ACFR’s mass casualty medical support bus and other rescue vehicles will be used to help with medical emergencies..

“We will go to Tallahassee tonight and from there we will get our orders on where we will be going and what our functions and duties will be,” Theus said..

“It will be an ambulance strike team for medical support.”.

The medical bus is equipped with stretchers, medicine and monitors with bunk space for 20 stretcher-bound patients or seating for 24..

When Hurricane Michael hit the eastern panhandle in 2018 the team evacuated hospitals and nursing homes that had been impacted by flooding, electric failures and building damage, Theus said..

Once the evacuation was done, the strike team assisted with 911 emergency response, Theus said..

“Usually the agencies that hurricanes impact are not only overrun with call load but fire rescue personnel who live in the area have their own personal life issues with homes and things like that,” Th.

Cantonment couple scrambled into attic to escape rising floodwaters caused by Hurricane Sally.

A Cantonment couple fled floodwaters early Wednesday morning by scrambling into their home’s attic as rising water streamed into their house around the door frame and poured into their living room thr.

Jack Hulgan, 84, and Elane Hulgan, 76, were trapped in their attic for nearly two hours as the water rose..

When they couldn’t reach 911, Elane took matters into her own hands..

"I had some blue spray paint, you know, out of a can?.

Well, I opened my front door and put 'In Attic HELP' right on the door,” she said..

"They must have seen my note because they came up riding these things.".

The Hulgans were two of about 40 people rescued from flood waters in northern Escambia County near Cantonment..

The National Guard transported them Wednesday morning to the Molino Community Center, which was turned into an emergency shelter for evacuees..

“I ruined our door,” Elane Hulgan said of her blue, spray-painted note..

Like many of their neighbors, the Hulgans said this was not their first time dealing with floods..

Their neighborhood of Bristol Park flooded in 2014, along with 300 nearby homes..

Now, we have to find a place to live until our house is repaired..

“You know," she added, "you can’t live in a place that’s going to grow mildew or mold, because that will kill you..

"  But above all, Jack Hulgan said he was grateful he and his wife made it out of their flooded home safely along with their dogs, two Shih Tzus named Sonny and Chipper.  ".

When they came on Jet Skis, they made us lie down on our stomachs on boards that they were pulling on the back of them,” Jack Hulgan said, while miming the experience..

And we hung with our free hands to board while we were on our stomachs, like this.”.

The firefighters took the Hulgans to a National Guard truck that drove them to the Molino Community Center..

"We’re still here, waiting for the National Guard to bring us back a bag with my husband’s medicine in it that I left in their truck," said Elane Hulgan..

Another couple, 63-year-old Norma Hickerson and 81-year-old Ernest Hickerson, were also saved from their Cantonment home by rescue crews on boats — despite Ernest Hickerson’s limited ability to move w.

“He’s very sick with major health problems,” Norma Hickerson said..

“But we were married six years ago, and I love him to death..

The Hickersons remained at the Molino Community Center late into the afternoon on Wednesday, trying to find a ride to the Veterans Affairs Hospital..

“He needs to be in an emergency room,” Hickerson said..

“But the ambulances said that they wouldn’t take him and me at the same time, and his doctor told me not to ever leave him by himself..

Now, we’re stuck here, trying to find help and a way to a hospital.”.

One of the youngest refugees at the Molino Community Center was 16-year-old Annie Perez..

“I was at home, and in no time, the water in our house was 3 feet deep, up to my knees..

My grandmother and I have lost everything we have: our cars, our couches and all the furniture, pretty much everything..

"  Perez said she has lived alone with her grandmother in northern Escambia County ever since her grandfather passed away two months ago..

She said she managed to guide her grandmother out of the house and call for help..

“There was water everywhere, but I knew I had to stay calm for my grandmother.”.

Hurricane Sally causes neighborhood flooding and road closures in Bay County.

BAY COUNTY, Fla. (WJHG/WECP) -  The waves from the gulf are rough as our area sees the impact of Hurricane Sally; however, the storm isn’t just affecting the beaches but much of Bay County further inl.

“Every time it rains really hard for more than 30 minutes to an hour, we flood," Panama City Beach resident Heath Armstrong said..

It’s the consistent rain that concerns Armstrong the most..

However, he isn’t riding out the storm unprepared..

“We prepared (with) sandbags and plywood and blocking up the doors," Armstrong said..

Just down the road, neighbor Sheila Matthews did the same..

“The only thing we can do is actually dam up around our entrances..

When it rains heavily on their street off Allison Avenue, it almost always floods, so much so you can take a kayak out..

“The roads completely cover up and then eventually all the culverts fill up that they actually put in our yard to help with the drainage but as soon as the drainage ditch behind this fills up, these t.

The problem persisted over in Panama City as well..

Flooding caused early road closures in the downtown area..

Also along Beach Drive signs cautioned drivers of roads underwater..

Back in Panama City Beach, residents said they have to play with the cards they’ve been dealt as they always do..

“You could say your neighborhood is flooded but that could just mean there’s a lot of major puddles in your road but ours actually floods to where there’s feet of water," Matthews said..

Both Armstrong and Matthews expect the flooding to get worse throughout the day if the heavy rain continues..

"When a hurricane is coming, you have to decide if you are better off with the peanuts dug and on top of the ground or still in the ground..

We made the decision to leave them in the ground -- we had good plant health, the vines and stems looked good..

"If those vines were nearing the end of their life, we might have decided it was better to have them above ground," he said..

A large rainfall could lock a grower out of fields for a week, and if vines are heavy with disease, that could result in many of the peanuts dropping off in the ground and big yield losses, Jenkins ad.

Dug peanuts can withstand some rain if healthy, but if vines are dry and diseased, a long harvesting delay can also lead to harvest losses..

Lots of rain at harvest can also lead to aflatoxin, which can drastically reduce the price paid for peanuts, Jenkins said..

"Hopefully, our peanuts were in good enough shape going into this that we won't have to worry about that much," he said..

While every farm has a different breakeven, Jenkins figures a $700-per-acre cost for producing peanuts -- which means he needs to produce 4,000 pounds per acre (2 tons) to break even..

Yields for his farm typically range from 4,500 to 5,200 pounds per acre..

He's also worried about the cotton crop as bolls are just beginning to open..

Large amounts of rain or sustained wetness can cause the cotton to fall from the boll or the seed inside the boll to rot or sprout..

"Cotton that hasn't opened should be fine, but then we have to worry about wind..

Before this storm, we were sitting on a bumper crop..

Prices were depressed, but we were thinking we might be able to break even because we had such a good crop coming on," he said..

Even if bolls aren't open, they tend to rot if they come in contact with the ground..

Crop insurance is an important safety net, but one Jenkins purchases hoping never to use..

He said enterprise pricing doesn't work for him since the farm is spread out over many different tracts of land with a wide range of yield histories..

This year he took advantage of a new hurricane insurance program that fills the gap and increases coverage from 70% to 95%..

It triggers automatically if there are sustained hurricane-force winds from a named storm in the county..

As winds swirl, thoughts of pandemics and politics mostly take a back seat..

However, Jenkins' wife, Debra, works in the medical field and he has one son in college and another in high school, so the presence of the problem is always there..

"We're trying to be socially responsible, but thankfully, it has not influenced us too much other than some inconveniences," he reported..

He has noticed the need to plan ahead if a farmer needs machinery parts, especially on some specialty equipment..

Last week he took time to bring a newly elected county commissioner to the farm..

"We have such an urban influence in our county, and it is important that we keep telling our story.  ".

It's the kind of relationship building we have to do in agriculture if we want people to understand what we are up against," he said..

REID THOMPSON -- COLFAX, ILLINOIS  Rollercoaster rainfall is what Reid Thompson has experienced this season..

His central and east-central Illinois farms recorded "lots" in April and May and barely a drop the bulk of June..

Then came record rainfall in July followed by little to nothing in August..

Now, 4 to 5 inches have fallen during the first half of September..

"Those September rains really helped our late-planted beans..

I pulled samples on them this week and wow, holy beans ... they're like real beans," Thompson exclaimed.  ".

Some of the beans have put on additional foliage and were showing some signs of lodging, which could cause some dry down and harvesting issues..

Thompson expects to open his first cornfields this week to work any glitches out of the new grain setup..

"If it is around 26%, we'll probably just keep harvesting," he said..

If the weather has been a rollercoaster, so has the year 2020..

Thompson said there's no question the pandemic has disrupted life in many ways..

His wife, Heather, works as manager of digital communications for Growmark..

So, during the shutdown earlier this year, they tag-teamed child care responsibilities..

"The boys have now been back for 16 weeks without incident, and I will say our providers have done an amazing job..

Still, other facilities in our area have had positive tests," he said..

Thompson noted that the family has felt the invasiveness of the virus as it has squashed inclinations to be social..

They've also felt the reprieve lifting of obligations has brought and watched family time come back into focus..

"I do worry about the small businesses in our local community and how they will survive this..

So many good people have seen their life's work disrupted," he said, specifically mentioning a small-town German restaurant that people often travel from afar to visit..

He's also seen the church and other local organizations rise to the occasion and find innovative ways to address the pandemic instead of being paralyzed by it..

"Still, we've taken communion once since March," he noted..

From a straight commodity agriculture standpoint, the fallout has been minimal, Thompson said..

Bin parts have been tough to come by, but he attributes that more to going to repairs from derecho destruction..

"Sometimes we've patched back together rather than try to count on a replacement part figuring to wait until this all passes.  ".

The economic tail on this could be long, though, and I wish we could just get back to business in this state..

I'm not discounting that the virus is real, but I'm also not sure that we're not going to have to learn how to live with it," Thompson said..

Plant shutdowns earlier in the crop season stalled seed bean deliveries, causing planting delays..

Those September rains made that issue fade as late-planted beans look to have as much or more potential than those he planted early this year..

Still, Thompson is growing XtendFlex soybeans -- the latest three-way herbicide trait from Bayer -- for seed production..

The new technology was expected to have a full commercial launch in 2021, but the trait does not yet have import approvals from the European Union (EU)..

Thompson can't help but wonder if some of the hold-up on those approvals can be pandemic related..

Last week he learned the seed will be subject to a totally stewarded harvest..

That places more harvesting protocols on growers than were originally planned..

"It's not going to be a simple harvest," Thompson said..

"Moving between fields with combines and grain carts and trucks -- everything becomes an orchestrated event..

We are looking at having to manage our grain system a little differently..

"There are also restrictions that have to be managed the following year with volunteers..

We also have about 10 to 15 acres that are used for isolation that can't go back to soybeans next year," Thompson said..

He noted that the politics of trait approvals becomes tiresome, particularly to farmers with their foot on the pedal..

"Farmers aren't patient when it comes to things that seem impractical," he acknowledged..

"But some of this comes with seed production, and we know that being able to segregate and do the right thing also adds to our value as farmers.".

Thompson, who is active in the Illinois Farm Bureau, is also watching what is going on politically as November elections..

I was pleased to see President (Donald) Trump sign an order allowing the ethanol industry to use 15% ethanol blends in 10% blend pumps..

“Our big concern is going to be the amount of flooding, the water that’s going to happen in the panhandle,” said Scott Dean, task force leader of Urban Search and Rescue Florida..

The task force met up in Miami Wednesday morning to check in before shipping up to Tallahassee as Sally continues to flood the panhandle..

“Task force members sacrifice their home life, their work life, they do leave for an extended period of time -- the commitment is 14 days,” Dean said..

The task force is made up of first responders, doctors, engineers, and K9 units..

The K9s are trained to find humans who are still alive in collapsed structures in these disaster situations..

Especially the fact we can save somebody’s life,” K9 handler Ana Kaufmann said..

The team was last deployed to Puerto Rico following the earthquake there, and before that they were sent to the Bahamas following Hurricane Dorian..

Unusual events elsewhere impact W.Va. weather this week.

Division of Forestry crews are helping to fight, is one of those western fires producing hazy skies over West Virginia this week  CHARLESTON, W.Va..

— A couple of weather phenomena this week elsewhere in the United States are impacting our conditions in West Virginia..

You may have noticed hazy skies in the Mountain State in the past couple of days..

The haze is not from any weather we are presently experiencing, it is literally smoke which has drifted eastward from fires burning in the western United States..

It’s a, ‘mist from the smoke of a distant fire,’ as the old song goes,” said Tom Mazza Meteorologist with the National Weather Service Charleston bureau..

The smoke from those fires has risen to the 20 to 25,000 foot level and is being carried our way along the jet stream..

Mazza said the distance isn’t uncommon since weather travels that far in a day or two under normal circumstances..

However, an event to cause such a level of smoke is unusual, although not unprecedented..

“This is not something that has never happened before..

With volcanic eruptions, the biggest eruptions spread volcanic ash even higher into the atmosphere and that ash will get all the way around the planet,” he explained..

The fires in California, Washington, and Oregon this week have created the worst air quality in the world for the region along the west coast and in cities impacted by the fires this week..

Here in West Virginia it has created some hazy conditions, but nothing more..

West Virginia could also see some incoming precipitation from Hurricane Sally making landfall Wednesday in the area near the Alabama/Florida border on the Gulf Coast..

But, Mazza said another weather system will impact the level of rain Sally is able to deliver to the Mountain State..

“We’re going to have a very cool air mass, even cooler than the one that is here now, spread into the area Thursday night and Friday and that will help shunt Sally to the south and east,” Mazza said..

There will be some limited precipitation to the most extreme southeast areas of West Virginia..

The weather system will bring in Arctic air from Canada which will be much more autumn like through the weekend and into next week with cooler temperatures and dry conditions..

“The deeper mountain valleys of the northern mountains and even down into the central mountains are likely to have frost this weekend,” he said..

Hurricane season: We're near the end of the alphabet — and it's not over yet | WeatherTiger.

Ryan Truchelut  WeatherTiger  Historically, Sept. 3 through Sept. 17 are the most active two weeks of the Atlantic hurricane season..

Nearly a quarter of the total tropical activity on record since 1851 has occurred in this frame..

This is a qualitative, subjective opinion: It feels like a quarter of recorded tropical activity has occurred between Sept. 3 and Sept. 17, 2020..

So much has happened in the last week and/or is happening in the Tropics that it's nearly impossible to summarize..

I’m going to bullet point this thing in alphabetical order, for both applicable alphabets, and hope for the best..

More:There's only one name left on the 2020 list of hurricane names..

The short version: We’re not done, and the Gulfs need to be on alert..

Yep, that’s "Gulfs," as in both “of Mexico” and “of Maine.”.

OVERALL: Seven named storms have developed thus far in September, beating the previous record of five through the 17th..

Of these, five — Paulette, Rene, Sally, Teddy and Vicky — occurred concurrently on Monday morning..

This ties the record for most contemporaneous tropical systems in the Atlantic, set on Sept. 12, 1971..

All these storms were earlier to claim their letters — by between 10 days and four weeks..

PAULETTE: This hurricane struck Bermuda as a Category 1 on Monday morning and has since turned northeast into the open Atlantic..

As of Wednesday morning, Paulette has transitioned to a non-tropical cyclone..

The storm may yet turn back south and reacquire some tropical or subtropical characteristics in three or four days over the open eastern Atlantic..

RENE: A weak tropical storm of no importance that dissipated earlier this week in the eastern Atlantic..

SALLY: As of the National Hurricane Center's 5 p.m. Wednesday advisory, Sally remains a tropical storm crawling across southern Alabama after making landfall just west of the Florida-Alabama border We.

Hurricane Sally:Rain for Big Bend, but high wind, flood risk for Gulf Coast  'It definitely keeps you going':Jim Cantore shares memories as he covers Sally — his 104th storm  Sally was yet another sto.

Sustained hurricane force winds and gusts on land to 100 mph were observed in the eyewall as it inched between Mobile and Pensacola, with surge of 5.5 feet in Pensacola Bay..

Despite impressive wind and surge, Sally’s worst impacts are widespread flash and river flooding across southern Alabama and western Florida..

Rain totals along the Panhandle coast from Apalachicola west are a foot or more, with widespread inland 5- to 10-inch totals along and west of the Apalachicola River..

Sally’s remnants will continue to spread 3- to 6-inch rainfall totals northeast across northern Georgia and into the Carolinas through Friday..

TEDDY: Hurricane Teddy is on the brink of becoming the second major (Category 3 or above) hurricane of the 2020 season, with maximum sustained winds currently around 100 mph..

Strengthening is likely over the next few days, as Teddy moves northwest well to the north of the Lesser Antilles..

Last week, many models were pegging Teddy as a potential risk to the U.S. coastline; however, because Teddy developed earlier than some scenarios suggested, it is turning north into the open Atlantic,.

Most modeling suggests Teddy will proceed north into the open Atlantic, but the European model shows an alternate case in which Teddy is flung northwest into northern New England through a binary inte.

There’s really only one good reference point for such an outcome in 170 years of hurricane history: Sandy..

By law, I must now mention that the Euro nailed Sandy..

However, “King” Euro has struggled mightily of late, turning in junk performances with Sally and Laura..

Overall, Teddy is worth monitoring for potential impacts to New England, but rare events are rare for a reason..

Let’s hold off on the hyperbole until this gets closer to fruition..

VICKY: Another weak tropical storm in the eastern Atlantic..

Still ongoing, but likely to dissipate prior to the weekend with zero impacts..

WILFRED, ALPHA, BETA, and SO FORTH: The lone remaining name on the normal, 21-name list is Wilfred..

Storms 22 and beyond will tap into the Greek alphabet, which only happened once previously — in 2005..

There are four potential candidates for these names in the next week..

Three of them, a currently non-tropical low near Portugal and two tropical waves in the eastern Atlantic, would likely be relatively short-lived and no threat if development occurred..

The final area to watch is a broad area of low pressure festering in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico..

With Sally clearing the Gulf, conditions will slowly become more conducive for development, and some organization is likely into the weekend..

If this becomes the next named storm, steering currents are very weak, and Wilfred could dog the Gulf for a week or more..

Depending on how the U.S. jet stream pattern evolves regarding Teddy, this system could eventually move north towards the U.S. Gulf Coast, or west into Mexico..

There is too much uncertainty at the moment to say more than that..

FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES  Water rescues were reported underway in both states Wednesday morning..

That included in Gulf Shores, Alabama, where homes flooded and trees toppled onto roofs, city spokesman Grant Brown said..

Sally made landfall as a Category 2 storm near Gulf Shores around 4:45 a.m. CT with sustained winds of 105 mph..

By 8 a.m. CT it was downgraded, 20 miles from Gulf Shores, with winds at 90 mph..

With Sally's slow pace -- generally 3 mph -- some areas already have collected more than 15 inches of rain and could receive up to 35 inches by storm's end..

Floodwaters have turned streets into rivers in Pensacola, Florida, images from the Associated Press show..

Pieces of hazardous debris "have become too numerous to list," police there warned..

Similar scenes unfolded around the same time -- still about six hours before Sally came ashore -- in midtown Mobile and across Mobile Bay in Fairhope, Alabama..

Sally hit Alabama 16 years to the day after the state's last landfalling hurricane, the Category 3 Hurricane Ivan, struck..

Businesses close and military bases restrict access  Businesses shut down ahead of the storm, with Walmart announcing 54 closures due to Sally, company spokesman Scott Pope told CNN on Tuesday..

Across the Gulf Coast, three military installations announced that only mission-essential personnel should report to work Wednesday..

The installations are the Naval Air Station Pensacola and Eglin Air Force Base in Pensacola, along with Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi, home to the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron,.

Residents prepared for a serious storm  People began preparing for Sally over the weekend, filling sandbags, grabbing supplies and prepping their homes..

Merrill Warren of Summerdale, Alabama, which sits about 16 miles inland from the Gulf, told CNN he brought in furniture, purchased gas and other supplies, and got his generator ready for the storm..

On Tuesday night, he reported that heavy rains and winds of up to 39 mph had already hit inland..

Warren was more concerned about the potential for increased rainfall and surges than anything else, he said..

"This isn't the first Category 1 Hurricane that I have been through..

I have been there through Hurricane Nate and Tropical Storm Gordon," Warren said. ".

I'm more worried about the rain for this one ... The rain and storms surge are definitely going to be the bigger issue with a storm moving at 2 mph..

The last time I can honestly say we got this much rain was in 2014 when we got 26 inches of rain in three days,” said Jersey..

Jersey says one positive for the area is it will be spared the strong winds..

“I’m glad there’s not a lot of wind, we’ve got a lot of pine trees in this area..

Pine trees are lightning’s best friend,” said Jersey..

“The fact that there’s not a lot of wind is great.”.

Freeport resident Leonard Stanley says he is trying to keep his work equipment safe from the storm since hurricanes can unexpectedly change track..

“I’m worried about my barge and my work crew, so the thing is I got it out of the water just in case it does make a turn,” said Stanley..

Stanley says this storm will cause more work for him and his crew..

“More rain, more damage, and that means more work,” said Stanley..

I’ve got a lot of friends on the water, some older folk, and they’ve spent quite a bit of money on it.”.

If residents are worried about flooding, Freeport High School will be opened as a shelter..

Cullman Power Board prepares for possible storms from Hurricane Sally.

CULLMAN, Ala. – The Cullman Power Board (CPB) is preparing for possible outages from storms related to Hurricane Sally..

“The best case scenario is for stabilizing weather fronts to impact the storm system and stabilize the severe characteristics of the approaching weather system,” said CPB General Manager Mike Manning..

“The worst case scenario is for the severe weather system to grow in intensity and maintain a severe storm capability as the storm continues to move inland and across the region.”.

Manning said his department is ready to answer the call if or when residents lose power inside the city..

“Severe storms typically present challenges to LPCs (local power companies) based on the duration and extent of damages..

Cullman Power Board (CPB) routinely maintains a state of readiness to respond to unexpected events,” he said..

With yet another hurricane making landfall this month in the Gulf, Manning spoke to the challenges CPB employees face, from the those answering calls to the linemen reconnecting power, during a major .

“When severe weather events such as hurricanes and tropical storms occur, CPB strives to restore all power as soon as possible in a safe and efficient manner..

Once power is restored to all CPB customers our crews typically assist other LPCs that still have customers in need of restoration,” he said..

“This work is performed in accordance with mutual aid agreements that are in place and operating prior to the storm event..

If CPB incurs substantial damage from a storm event, CPB will receive mutual aid assistance from other regional LPCs and/or contract utility crews.”.

Manning said patience is always key when linemen are reconnecting lines and he urged any resident who loses power to report the outage and stay indoors..

“CPB appreciates the patience and understanding of our customers..

Rest assured that CPB crews and assisting crews will continue to work as hard as we can to restore power service in the safest and most expedient manner as possible,” he stated..

In the event of downed power lines, said Manning, residents should call in the outage to the CPB’s hotline at 256-734-2343 and then stay indoors until the issue is resolved..

“CPB customers should stay inside and away from downed power lines..

All lines should be treated as an energized line and extreme caution should be exercised,” he said..

“Contact CPB to report downed power lines at once..

The roadways should be kept as clear as possible for emergency and utility crews to be able to respond to emergency matters as well as the restoration of power service.”.

Manning said residents should also be prepared in case of outages or prolonged outages..

“Customers should have an ample supply of non-perishable food, batteries, blankets and other vital resources on hand to ‘shelter in place’ until power and other utility services are fully restored,” h.

Manning finished up with an important message regarding the safety of the linemen who must be out during, and immediately following, storms..

“The restoration of power in a storm recovery is very hazardous work,” he said..

“CPB would request that everyone pray for the safety of not only the utility crews working to restore power, but also for all other police, fire and rescue, street and debris clearance crews and all o.

Hurricane Sally makes landfall on Alabama's Gulf Coast.

Hurricane Sally made landfall on Alabama's Gulf Coast on Wednesday morning as a Category Two hurricane, spreading strong winds inland across southeastern Alabama and western Florida..

Upon landfall, winds were clocked at 105 miles per hour (165 km per hour), able to cause extensive damage, according to the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale..

The hurricane also poses the risk of "catastrophic and life-threatening" flooding along portions of the north-central Gulf Coast, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory around 6 am CDT (110.

The NHC earlier said the hurricane could bring more than 2 feet (60 cm) of rain to some areas as it creeps inland..

Sally made landfall at Gulf Shores, Alabama, and was creeping toward the Alabama-Florida border at 3 mph (5 kph)..

Its winds and rains will stretch from Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle, the NHC said..

In Dauphin Island, Alabama, winds sustained 81 mph (130 kph), while in Pensacola, Florida, winds were at 61 mph (98 kph), NHC said..

In Mobile, Alabama, strong winds shook windows while trees and power lines swayed..

Officials across the South had called on residents of low-lying areas to shelter away from the winds and rain..

But for some, Hurricane Sally's slow approach brought a chance to relive childhood memories of storms past, and to witness the power of nature first-hand..

Thomas Harms braved the wind and rains on Tuesday to watch the waves crash into the Fairhope Municipal Pier, and reminisced about past storms..

As a child, he went with his grandfather to see storms arrive, and he did the same on Tuesday for his son..

"It kind of takes a little bit of the fear out of it and also help you understand the dangers of it too," said Harms..

"I've been kind of passing that on to my son in doing the same thing.".

ADVERTISEMENT    Others joined him on the pier to catch a glimpse of what was to come..

"We were at home saying 'we're bored', so I was like 'how 'bout we go to Fairhope and see how bad it is out there..

Damage from Sally is expected to reach $2 billion to $3 billion, said Chuck Watson of Enki Research, which tracks tropical storms and models the cost of their damage..

That estimate could rise if the heaviest rainfall happens over land, Watson said..

Ports, schools and businesses were closed along the coast as Sally churned..

As the storm track shifted east, ports along the Mississippi River were reopened to travel on Wednesday..

But they were closed to vessel traffic from Biloxi, Mississippi, to Pascagoula, Florida..

Energy companies also shut more than a quarter of US Gulf of Mexico offshore oil and gas production and some refiners halted or slowed operations..

Hurricane Sally moves ashore, bringing “catastrophic and life-threatening” flooding.

Governor Ron DeSantis plans to tour storm-ravaged northwest Florida Thursday in a Coast Guard flyover in the wake of Hurricane Sally, which made landfall early Wednesday, bringing “catastrophic and li.

In a press conference Wednesday night at the Florida Emergency Operations Center, DeSantis said no fatalities have been linked to the storm so far and that 600 search-and-rescue missions are in progre.

He described damage seen so far as severe, with 30 inches of rainfall flooding parts of Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties, as well as Alabama counties to the west..

DeSantis said 130,000 residents in Escambia County, the hardest hit, are without power..

He expects utility crews staged in the region to start working on power restoration Thursday where conditions allow..

He also warned that meteorologists expect local rivers and restricted bodies of water to crest and flood in coming days as rain continues to pour down..

Hurricane Sally made landfall as a strong Category 2 storm just west of Pensacola, bringing high winds, high storm surge and torrential rainfall to the northern Gulf coasts of Alabama and Florida..

It was on track to come ashore farther west but made a late “wobble” to the east, creating more impact on Florida than was expected, DeSantis said..

The National Hurricane Center reported “catastrophic and life-threatening flooding” in the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama, and it issued ongoing warnings about flooding and tornadoes as Sally .

DeSantis announced he dispatched 500 Florida National Guard men and women and is sending high-water vehicles, helicopters and urban search-and-rescue teams to the disaster areas to begin operations wh.

During an interview with the Weather Channel, DeSantis warned residents that flooding in this case is even more dangerous than the high winds, which reached sustained speeds of 105 mph, according to t.

He urged residents to move away from floodwaters, which he predicted will worsen substantially..

You’re going to see more and more water accumulate,” he said..

“What will happen is, as this storm continues to move past places like Pensacola and goes north, the water that it drops north of the Panhandle is also going to impact floods that could happen several.

So this is not something that’s going to be a one- or two-day thing..

People are going to have to be vigilant for one or two days.”.

DeSantis told the Weather Channel he plans to visit the region this week when the storm moves out of the region..

He expressed confidence that state and local emergency managers, first responders and shelter providers know how to handle the emergency, even in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic..

DeSantis urged evacuees to maintain their health safety protocols as much as possible to avoid contracting COVID-19 during the emergency..

The Federal Emergency Management Agency on Wednesday approved federal disaster relief funding for additional Florida counties, now 13, reflecting state disaster declarations issued by the governor Tue.

The expanded FEMA order authorizes federal disaster relief for Bay, Escambia, Holmes, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Walton and Washington counties and limited assistance for nearby counties of Calhoun, Frankl.

The federal declarations make direct public assistance, equipment and resources available to the 13 counties, atop state and local resources, according to FEMA’s Region 4 office, whose jurisdiction in.

SpaceX on target for next Starlink launch from Kennedy Space Center.

Update: SpaceX stands down from Thursday launch attempt due to a recovery issue..

Next possible launch opportunity is 1:57 p.m. Friday..

While Hurricane Sally batters the Gulf Coast of the Florida panhandle, here on the Space Coast, SpaceX is still targeting for a Thursday afternoon launch of another round of Starlink communication sat.

Scheduled to liftoff no earlier than 2:17 p.m. from Kennedy Space Center pad 39A, SpaceX will launch its 13th batch of Starlink satellites atop its Falcon 9 rocket..

Weather is currently 60% "go" for the Thursday attempt..

"On Thursday, winds veer southwesterly across Central Florida as the remnants of Sally merge with a frontal system across Alabama and Georgia," according to the 45th Space Wing..

"This will both delay the development of the east coast sea breeze, and push activity from west to east across the state, increasing the chances for afternoon and evening showers and thunderstorms at .

The primary weather concern will be rain showers and thunderstorms, though the majority are expected to occur after the launch window..

In the event of a delay, weather drops to 40% "go" for a Friday attempt..

Approximately eight minutes after liftoff, the rocket's first-stage booster will target an automatic drone ship landing stationed in the Atlantic Ocean..

Upon success of this mission, SpaceX will have nearly 800 Starlink satellites in low-Earth orbit..

SpaceX engineer Kate Tice said during SpaceX's last Starlink launch earlier this month, "the Starlink team is on the beginning stages of our global space-based internet constellation but we are well i.

The eventual plan is to have tens of thousands of Starlink satellites in low-Earth orbit providing internet connection to those living in rural, underserved communities around the world..

If the Starlink constellation is successful, it will also help fund CEO Elon Musk's dream of sending humans to live on Mars..

As for upcoming launches on the Space Coast, United Launch Alliance is targeting no earlier than Sept. 26 of its Delta IV Heavy launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 37..

Two earlier attempts had been tried last month but both were forced to scrub due to technical issues..

CEO Tory Bruno said last week teams found the root problem and were working to resolve it..

Hurricane Sally: slow-moving storm kills one and leaves 'historic' flooding across US Gulf coast.

Hurricane Sally left a trail of chaos and damage on the US Gulf coast on Wednesday, with pounding rain and winds whipping above 100mph as the huge category 2 storm system ground ashore at just 2mph – .

The storm, which has killed at least one person, later accelerated to 3mph and then 5mph as it battered the metropolitan areas of Pensacola, Florida, and Mobile, Alabama, encompassing nearly a million.

The US National Hurricane Center called the flooding on the Alabama-Florida coastline “historic and catastrophic”..

The death occured in Orange Beach, Alabama, Mayor Tony Kennon told the Associated Press, but more details were not immediately available..

The storm cast boats on to land or sank them at the dock, flattened palm trees, peeled away roofs, blew down signs and knocked out power to more than a half-million homes and businesses..

A replica of Christopher Columbus’s ship the Niña that had been docked at the Pensacola waterfront was missing, police said..

The storm also ripped away a large section of a fishing pier at Alabama’s Gulf state park on the very day a ribbon-cutting had been scheduled following a $2.4m renovation..

By the afternoon, authorities in Escambia county said at least 377 people had been rescued from flooded areas..

More than 40 people trapped by high water were brought to safety within an hour, including a family of four found in a tree, Sheriff David Morgan said..

Officials also announced a three-day dusk-to-dawn curfew in the county, where the storm turned some Pensacola streets into rivers for a time..

Water rushed down some streets like river rapids, forming whitecaps as it slapped against buildings and rose above the tires on cars..

Emergency crews plucked people from flooded homes and coast guard helicopters buzzed the disaster zone looking for people in trouble..

Before sunrise, water was up to the doors of Jordan Muse’s car outside the Pensacola hotel, where her family took shelter after fleeing their mobile home..

Her eight-year-old son played with toys underneath the hotel room desk as Muse peered out the window, watching rain fly by in sheets..

“The power trucks are the only ones above water, and they’re the biggest,” Muse said, adding: “I can’t believe it got so bad.”.

Above the loud whistling of the wind, she heard what sounded like transformers exploding..

“I don’t feel safe to leave,” Lamar-Acuff said from the porch of a neighbor’s house..

Sally also tore away a large section of a newly renovated fishing pier at Alabama’s Gulf state park and knocked out power to more than a half-million homes and businesses across the region..

By early afternoon, Sally had weakened into a tropical storm, with winds down to 70mph, but the worst may be yet come, with heavy rain expected into Thursday as the storm pushes inland over Alabama an.

Like the wildfires raging on the west coast, the onslaught of hurricanes this season has once again focused attention on the climate crisis, which scientists say is causing slower, rainier, more power.

The storm’s eye wall, with winds topping 105mph, reached land near Gulf Shores, Alabama, at 4.45am local time on Wednesday..

Cullman Electric Cooperative prepares for Hurricane Sally.

CULLMAN, Ala. – Cullman Electric Cooperative Manager of Communications & External Affairs Brian Lacy on Tuesday said crews are ready to begin any necessary repairs caused by storms from Hurricane Sall.

“We always keep a close eye on what the weather is doing in the Gulf Mexico during hurricane season..

Fortunately, we are far enough away from the Gulf Coast that we don’t have to take the same precautions and preparations as electric co-ops closer to the coast..

We follow the latest updates from the National Weather Service so we are prepared for any weather that might impact our service area,” Lacy said..

“We also stay in close communication with our statewide office, the Alabama Rural Electric Association, as they help coordinate repair efforts..

If other cooperatives in Alabama or neighboring states need help after a storm, once we know our area is safe, we work with AREA to get our linemen and equipment headed to the areas that need help.”.

While Cullman County is in the northern portion of the state there is a possibility of rough weather..

“The best case scenario for this storm is the severe weather misses our area, we get some much needed rain, and our linemen can be called upon if needed to help other communities that are impacted by .

“There is always the possibility the storm could change its track and some of the severe weather impacts our area, in which case our crews will be ready to respond to any power outages as soon as it i.

If the worst were to happen, Lacy said he is confident the linemen and crews will respond quickly to repair damaged transformers or downed lines..

“From the co-op’s perspective, any storm system presents a possibility of power outages due to lightning and high wind that can cause trees or large branches to fall on power lines..

Have a weather radio and a good weather app on their cell phone,” he said..

“Sign up for the Cullman Electric Cooperative text message outage reporting, and follow the co-op’s outage map on our website or by downloading the Cullman Electric Cooperative mobile app.”.

While those repairs are taking place residents may want to take stock in what supplies they have on hand..

“A storm emergency kit with flashlights, extra batteries, bottled water and some non-perishable food is a good thing to have in your house at all times,” he said..

WDHN Storm Team: Hurricane Sally to bring severe weather to the Tri-State.

DOTHAN, Ala. (WDHN) — The rain slowly crept up from the Panhandle and into the Wiregrass this morning, and it isn’t going anywhere any time soon..

With the potential for flooding rains and a few tornadoes, it will be a long next 24-36 hours for Tri-State residents..

A Flash Flood Watch is active for all of the Tri-State area until 7 AM CDT Thursday..

There is a FLASH FLOOD WARNING for Holmes County right now, and it goes until 11:45 PM CDT tonight..

With rainfall amounts expected to be as high as 10″ for our Western Wiregrass residents, numerous Flash Flood Warnings are expected to be issued throughout the next 36 hours..

But those closer to the AL/GA state border won’t escape heavy rainfall..

They could see between 3-6″ on top of what has already fallen today..

If you see water covering the roadways: TURN AROUND, DON’T DROWN!.

You never know if the road has washed out from underneath the surface of the water..

Also, keep and eye out for children and pets that may be tempted to play in any rushing water..

All streams and rivers should be avoided through the end of the week at the minimum..

More water will likely move from Central AL into our area this week and weekend, so river and streams could stay high for quite some time..

A Tornado Watch is in place for the Panhandle including Jackson and Holmes (FL) counties as well as the most southern portions of Seminole (GA) and Covington (AL) counties until 6 AM CDT..

This likely won’t be our last Tornado Watch because the threat for brief tornadoes continues tomorrow..

Tomorrow’s severe weather will encompass all of the Wiregrass as it extends even further inland and farther east than today..

A Marginal Risk (1/5) is in place for all of our viewing area while a Slight Risk (2/5) is currently expected for our Panhandle and extreme SW Georgia residents..

Create and discuss tornado procedures with your family tonight, so they will know what to do in case a tornado warning is issued for your area..

While most Tri-State residents won’t see very high winds from this system, tree branches and limbs could still break off and become a hazard along roadways..

These limbs could also fall on power lines and create power outages..

Contact local authorities immediately to report any downed power lines..

After Sally moves out of our area later this week, things will change drastically; but this time, it will be for the better..

A cold front will help usher Sally to the east and bring much cooler and drier air to almost all of the Southeast US as mostly sunny skies prevail at the beginning of next week..

Hurricane Sally creeps toward coast, threatening 'a ridiculous amount of rain'.

Slow-moving Hurricane Sally was dumping heavy rainfall over parts of the Gulf Coast on Tuesday, hours before the storm was expected to bring an even greater deluge when it makes landfall as a Category.

The National Hurricane Center warned of "extreme life-threatening" and "historic" flash flooding along the northern Gulf Coast..

Sally was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane at midnight, and the center said it had sustained winds of 100 mph..

The storm Tuesday night was 65 miles south of Mobile, whipping up maximum sustained winds of 85 mph..

Landfall was expected between Mobile and Gulf Shores, Alabama, between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. Wednesday, according to NBC News meteorologist Bill Karins..

The storm was only moving at 2 mph and wasn't expected to speed up much before making landfall with lingering rainfall that could last up to two days..

In an update Tuesday night, the center described the hurricane's progress as "creeping.".

Some areas from the western Florida Panhandle to far southeastern Mississippi could see up to 30 inches, according to the NHC..

The center predicts water heights of 6 to 9 feet from Ocean Springs, Mississippi to Dauphin Island, Alabama, if peak surge coincides with high tide..

Rain fell sideways and rain began covering roads in Pensacola, Florida, and Mobile, Alabama..

A curfew was ordered in the coastal Alabama city of Gulf Shores..

President Donald Trump approved Florida's request for a federal disaster declaration, which will allow taxpayer assistance to go to victims in impacted counties..

Up to a foot of rain had fallen already on the coast by Tuesday night and Sally’s lumbering pace meant there would likely be extended deluges..

More than 60,000 homes and businesses also lost power in coastal Alabama and western Florida Panhandle as conditions deteriorated..

Jonathan Bachman / Reuters  “This is the real deal, and it deserves your attention,” Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves wrote on Twitter..

"  Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards on Tuesday said New Orleans was no longer a direct target of Sally.  ".

Good news to report today as it relates to hurricane Sally, and that is that the track has continued to shift eastward," he said. ".

That really has been the case, since Sunday morning when it looked like the Greater New Orleans metro area was in for a direct hit from Sally..

"  The city of New Orleans said in a statement, "Significant impacts from Hurricane Sally are no longer anticipated in the local area..

"  President Donald Trump tweeted late Monday that he was closely monitoring “extremely dangerous Hurricane Sally.".

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey thanked the president "for approving our request so quickly.".

"We will continue closely monitoring the developments today, and I urge everyone in the coastal areas south of I-10 and in low-lying areas to take all precautions and heed advice from weather experts .

I urge you in the strongest way possible to evacuate and seek shelter as this storm makes landfall tonight," she urged residents Tuesday..

Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson pointed out that the grounds were already saturated from weeks of rain, which would increase flooding..

He said damage from wind "is going to be unbelievable" since the languid storm would essentially be parked over areas..

Download the NBC News app for breaking news  In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in the Panhandle's westernmost counties, Escambia and Santa Rosa, as the hurricane's outer band.

Eric Gilmore, head of Escambia County's Division of Emergency Management, said evacuations in Pensacola Beach and other low lying areas were voluntary for now..

"Do what you need to do now to get out of harm’s way," he said at news conference on Tuesday afternoon..

Escambia was one of 13 counties newly covered by the governor's expanding emergency declaration..

The Florida Department of Transportation closed Pensacola Bay Bridge, which connects Gulf Breeze to Pensacola, after a barge struck the crossing, according to state and local officials..

State inspectors were expected to assess the damage when it's safe to do so..

For only the second time on record, forecasters said, five tropical cyclones swirled simultaneously in the Atlantic basin at one point on Monday..

CNN —  Hundreds of people near the Florida-Alabama border were being rescued from floodwaters brought on by Sally on Wednesday and authorities fear many more could be in danger in coming days..

“We had 30 inches of rain in Pensacola – 30-plus inches of rain – which is four months of rain in four hours,” Ginny Cranor, chief of the Pensacola Fire Department, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesda.

FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES  Pensacola and other parts of Florida and Alabama were submerged by flooding, rivers were approaching dangerous levels and numerous counties were under curfews to keep residents sa.

“We are still in an evaluation and lifesaving recovery mission, and we need to be able to do that job,” said Robert Bender, commissioner in Escambia County, Florida..

Sally unleashed up to 30 inches of rain from the Florida Panhandle to Mobile Bay, Alabama, leading to “historic and catastrophic flooding” there and threatening even more communities as it moves north.

In Escambia County, which includes Pensacola, at least 377 people have been rescued from flooded neighborhoods, Jason Rogers, the county’s public safety director, told reporters in a news briefing..

“It’s going to be a long time, folks … to come out of this thing,” Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan said earlier Wednesday, warning there could be thousands of evacuations..

Sally Surprise: Last Minute Intensification Prior to Landfall.

During the 10pm CT advisory update from the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Hurricane Sally was creeping to the north-northeast at 2 mph, inching its way closer to the Gulf coast as a category 1 hurr.

But since then, Sally has undergone a surprise intensification cycle which brought it to category 2 status at 1am CT..

New data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft investigating the storm and the Mobile, Alabama Doppler weather RADAR indicate that Sally’s maximum sustained winds have increased to 105 mph.

In a special update from the NHC, they located the center of Hurricane Sally at 29.9N, 87.8W, roughly 60 miles south-southeast of Mobile, Alabama and 55 miles southwest of Pensacola, Florida..

The estimated minimum central pressure is down to 968 mb or 28.58 inches..

With maximum sustained winds now up to 105 mph, Hurricane Sally is now a mid-range Category 2 hurricane..

Should winds increase just 6 mph more, it would be re-classified as a Category 3 hurricane..

While higher maximum sustained winds could lead to a more significant storm surge and more wind damage, the major threat of epic flooding remains..

Historic, life-threatening flash flooding due to rainfall is likely through Wednesday along and just inland of the coast from the Florida Panhandle west of the Apalachicola River to the Alabama/Missis.

Widespread moderate to major river flooding is forecast across the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama..

Near the area of landfall, storm total precipitation could reach up to 30″ in some areas; a widespread 1.5-2.5 feet are possible elsewhere..

Floating Islands of Fire Ants Spotted in Hurricane Sally Floodwater.

Hurricane Sally is bringing floating islands of fire ants to parts of Florida as the Category 2 storm makes landfall along the Gulf Coast..

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has issued a special advisory for the storm, which now has winds of 105 mph..

It said: "Historic, life-threatening flooding is likely along portions of the northern Gulf Coast," and that flash floods due to rainfall are likely throughout Wednesday..

Areas forecast to flood include southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle..

The NHC said inland portions of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the western Carolinas could also be affected over the course of the week..

According to WKRG, floating islands of fire ants were recorded by Jason Garcia, a photographer for the broadcaster..

He saw an island of these venomous insects at Civitian Park in Pensacola, Florida..

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are now five times more fire ants per acre in the U.S. than there are in South America, where they are native to..

The insects came to the U.S. to escape their natural enemies..

They are now found across southern states, including Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South and North Carolina..

They also have a small presence in California, and Arizona, as well as Mexico..

Fire ants bite and sting, injecting venom that causes an intense burning sensation..

"Red bumps form at the sting, and within a day or two they become white fluid-filled pustules," the CDC says..

Floating islands of fire ants are often seen after storms and floods..

In 2018, videos emerged of these rafts appearing in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence hit the state..

At the time, the Weather Channel said the ants turn their bodies into rafts, with tiny hairs trapping a layer of air that protects those at the bottom of the raft from drowning..

It said the ants can remain on these islands for weeks, so "beware near floodwaters.".

Fire ant islands were also reported after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas in 2017..

Footage from a river in Cuero showed huge swathes of fire ants in the water, prompting Alex Wild, curator of entomology at the University of Texas at Austin, to tweet: "I have never, in my entire care.

I have never, in my entire career as an ant researcher, seen *anything* like this..

https://t.co/jIjTOo3fZc — Alex Wild (@Myrmecos) August 29, 2017  Pro tip: Don't touch the floating fire ant colonies..

#Harvey pic.twitter.com/uwJd0rA7qB — Mike Hixenbaugh (@Mike_Hixenbaugh) August 27, 2017  Craig Tovey, from the Georgia Institute of Technology, has studied how fire ants create these rafts in order to.

Writing for The Conversation after Harvey hit, he said ants will clump together and then flatten out to create "a circular pancake" that can float within just minutes..

He said there were no fire ant islands after Katrina hit in 2005 because the storm surge happened so fast the ants did not have time to escape their nests and drowned..
