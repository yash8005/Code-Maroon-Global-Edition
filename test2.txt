The Lilac fire now 92 percent contained, Cal Fire officials said Tuesday morning.\n\nThe county of San Diego has opened a Local Assistance Center to help victims of the fire begin the rebuilding and recovery process. The center is at the Vista branch library on 700 Eucalyptus Avenue and will be open from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
\n\nServices offered will include crisis counseling and referral services, short term housing referrals and a mobile medical clinic. Homeowners also will be able to get information on residential rebuilding and consumer fraud.\n\nThe Lilac fire charred about 4,100 acres and destroyed 157 structures and damaged 64 buildings, at last count. 
All evacuation orders were lifted Sunday.\n\nFire officials say damage assessment teams from Cal Fire and other fire agencies are continuing to inspect fire areas.\n\nSanta Ana winds fail to materialize\n\nSan Diego was lashed by Santa Anas when the Lilac fire broke out midday Thursday. Early Sunday, the winds were largely blowing in the mountains and foothills, with gusts from 35 mph to 70 mph, but high winds failed to materialize in the burn areas, which helped firefighters greatly in their efforts to douse hot spots. The red flag fire weather warning expired Sunday night.

A destructive wildfire driven by strong winds swept through northern San Diego County on Thursday, moving toward Oceanside and other coastal communities and forcing new evacuations as it consumed homes.\n\nThe fast-moving Lilac fire spread through the Bonsall area, charring 4,100 acres along the State Route 76 corridor, destroying 20 structures and threatening 5,000 more. Powerful Santa Ana winds fanned flames westward.\n\n\u201cPeople need to be ready because this fire could make it all the way through Oceanside to the coast if it continues,\u201d Cal Fire Division Chief Nick Schuler told reporters Thursday evening. The 76 was closed at Interstate 15.\n\nThree people were burned when they couldn\u2019t escape flames fast enough, while another was hospitalized with smoke inhalation. Two firefighters were also injured, one with smoke inhalation and another after dislocating a shoulder. The latter popped his shoulder back in and returned to work, authorities said.\n\nAn estimated 25 horses died when flames ripped through the San Luis Rey Training Center, a thoroughbred racehorse facility on Camino Del Rey where nearly 500 horses were stabled, according to the California Horse Racing Board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome horses were evacuated before fire officials said it was too dangerous to enter the area to pick up the remaining horses, the board said in a statement.\n\nWorkers initially tried to coax the horses onto a main track at the center, but as flames encroached, they simply set the panicky horses free.\n\nThey risked getting trampled to let the animals out of their stalls.\n\n\u201cThere are horses running all loose down here,\u201d trainer Cliff Sise told the bloodhorse.com, which covers horse racing and breeding. \u201cPeople have lost horses. Barns have burned down. It just happened so fast that [we] had to do something.\u201d\n\nMany of the horses that survived were taken to the Del Mar Racetrack. But as of 7:30 p.m. Thursday, about 30 horses were still at the center waiting to be evacuated. And some were still missing, as nightfall prevented officials from thoroughly searching the area.\n\nBy late Thursday, a shopping center was being consumed by the blaze. At the Rancho Monserate Country Club, a swath of upscale mobile homes bordering a golf course had already been reduced to ash and twisted metal.\n\nResidents of Vista, Oceanside, Fallbrook, Bonsall and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton who weren\u2019t already ordered to evacuate were told to be ready to flee. Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in the county as night-flying helicopters prepared to make water drops.\n\n\u201cThis is a wind-driven fire that is moving at a dangerous rate,\u201d Cal Fire Capt. Jon Heggie said. \u201cThis is an extremely dynamic situation. We\u2019re trying our best to get out ahead of it to try and keep people safe.\u201d\n\nIn Murrieta, a fast-moving wildfire destroyed at least one home and triggered evacuations, most of which were lifted late Thursday. The blaze, reported about 1:15 p.m. near Los Alamos and Liberty roads, scorched 300 acres in about three hours and is 10% contained, according to Cal Fire. About 300 firefighters were tackling flames moving through heavy fuels. Dozens of residents were left without power.\n\nThe new blazes come as fatigued firefighters in Los Angeles County began to make progress on major fires that together have destroyed or damaged more than 30 homes and prompted the evacuations of more than 100,000 people.\n\nThe 475-acre Skirball fire in Bel-Air has not grown in nearly a day, a testament to the overnight assault that crews launched on the western and northern edges of the fire, close to the 405 Freeway and multimillion-dollar homes, officials said.\n\nThe 30% containment figure means firefighters have cleared brush to make a fire break, or hauled in hoses, to stop the blaze from advancing along about one-third of the fire\u2019s perimeter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not done,\u201d said Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Ralph Terrazas. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of this event.\u201d\n\nOne firefighter was injured early Wednesday and is receiving treatment for burns on his neck.\n\nThe LAFD tested a new technology Thursday: a drone that used thermal imaging to seek out hot spots, a high-tech way of directing crews to areas that need attention. The drone will also assess property damage, Terrazas said.\n\nThe Skirball fire destroyed four houses on Casiano Road, Moraga Drive and Linda Flora Drive, and damaged a dozen others.\n\nThe Creek fire in the mountains above Sylmar was more destructive. It burned 15,323 acres, destroyed 15 structures and damaged an additional 15. By Thursday evening, the blaze was 20% contained. Authorities expected that number to rise and lifted most evacuation orders, allowing many residents to return home.\n\nThough flames were burning much less intensely, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti warned residents that it\u2019s still an insecure time.\n\n\u201cWe still have winds that, through Saturday, can pick up without any notice,\u201d he said.\n\nCarlos Angulo, a U.S. Postal Service letter carrier, wound his way up and down Kagel Canyon Road on Thursday, familiar with the neighbors \u2014 many of whom work in the film industry \u2014 on his route.\n\nExcept now, the street was lined with charred trees, melted playground equipment and destroyed homes, casualties of the Creek fire.\n\nAngulo, who has worked this route for about 13 years, pulled up outside the ashes of one home. He greeted the owner by name, as well as another resident \u2014 handing them both their mail.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to hold the mail for you in the office until you find a place or something,\u201d Angulo told the woman, who was seeing her destroyed home for the first time.\n\nThe woman he\u2019d delivered mail to was visibly shaken, as she looked at what was left of her home. She declined to speak for an interview.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like my family. I see them every day,\u201d Angulo said. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad.\u201d\n\nOutside her home, neighbor Mathew Trippler introduced himself to the woman and told her how sorry he was.\n\nHis home, a little farther down, had survived the blaze.\n\n\u201cIt went the first night?\u201d she asked him.\n\nHe told her he thought it had.\n\nShe told him she\u2019d awakened to red windows on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI hope my cat got out,\u201d she told Trippler.\n\nResidents heard from the fire department that 10 homes burned in Kagel Canyon.\n\nThe San Diego-Union Tribune contributed to this report.\n\nalene.tchekmedyian@latimes.com | Twitter: @alenetchek\n\nbrittny.mejia@latimes.com | Twitter: @brittny_mejia\n\nUPDATES:\n\n12:15 a.m.: This article was updated with more information about structures burned.\n\n12:05 a.m.: This article was updated with information about the horses that died in the fire.\n\n10 p.m.: This article was updated with new information from authorities.\n\nThis article was originally published at 9:10 p.m.
