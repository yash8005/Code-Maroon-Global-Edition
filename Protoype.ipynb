san diego. the fire expanded to 4 square miles in a matter of hours and tore through the tightly packed rancho monserate country club community in the small city of fallbrook, known for its avocado orchards and horse ranches. at least two people were hospitalized with burns. the destructive blaze broke out as firefighters were trying to corral major wildfires around the los angeles area and 130 miles north near ventura, where a massive fire threatened ojai, a scenic mountain town dubbed \"shangri-la\" and known for its boutique hotels and new age spiritual retreats. like other fires that have broken out this week, fallbrook has a history of destructive blazes. ten years ago, as fall fires raced across southern california, a blaze in fallbrook injured five people, destroyed 206 homes and burned 14 square miles the latest on southern california wildfires:4:50 p.m. at least 20 homes have burned in a retirement community as a wildfire surges through northern san diego county. the homes are burning in the tightly-packed rancho monserate country club community in the small city of fallbrook. the wind-whipped blaze, dubbed the lilac fire, erupted thursday afternoon and authorities say it\\'s moving dangerously fast. two people have been burned and about 4 square miles (10 square kilometers) of land have been blackened. the blaze is one of at least five destructive fires burning in southern california. a fire that flared thursday afternoon in the murrieta area of riverside county, north of san diego county, has destroyed at least one home.3:40 p.m. authorities say they are treating two people who were burned as a fast-moving wildfire raged through a rural part of san diego county. california state fire officials said thursday that the two victims were being taken to a hospital. the fire has burned more than 1,000 acres and destroyed at least five buildings. fire officials say more than 1,000 others are threatened around the community of bonsall. they say the fire is \"growing at a dangerous rate of spread.\"___ 3:05 p.m. a fast-growing wildfire fanned by santa ana winds in rural san diego county has burned 1,000 acres (400 hectares) only hours after starting. state fire authorities said thursday more than five buildings have been destroyed, an unknown number has been damaged and more than 1,000 others are threatened around bonsall. the picturesque community of 4,000 people amid rolling hills is known for its equestrian facilities. officials shut down state highway 76 in both directions, ordered mandatory evacuations around bonsall and opened shelters at schools and casinos. the blaze started shortly after 11 a.m. state officials said the military was assisting with helicopters. the area is near camp pendleton marine corps base. it\\'s the latest wind-driven fire in southern california, including destructive blazes to the northwest in los angeles and ventura counties.___ 2:50 p.m. a text alert about dangerous fire weather conditions that was sent to 12 million southern californians in seven counties was the widest ever issued by the state office of emergency services. winds early thursday turned out not to be as dire as predicted, but emergency service deputy director kelly huston says the office erred on the side of caution because conditions were similar to those that led to 44 deaths in fires that broke out across northern california on oct. 8. huston says he would rather be criticized for potentially annoying someone than for not delivering a critical alert. some northern californians complained they never received evacuation alerts as the firestorms developed, and state lawmakers on thursday announced plans to introduce legislation establishing statewide emergency alert protocols.___ 2:45 p.m. a fast-moving wildfire fanned by santa ana winds has burned more than 500 acres (200 hectares) in rural san diego county within hours of starting. state fire authorities said thursday more than five buildings have been destroyed, an unknown number has been damaged and more than 1,000 others are threatened around the community of bonsall. officials shut down state highway 76 in both directions and ordered mandatory evacuations around bonsall. the blaze started shortly after 11 a.m. evacuations include a mobile home park, a golf course country club and two schools. two lanes of interstate 15 are also closed. it\\'s the latest wind-driven fire in southern california, including destructive blazes to the northwest in los angeles and ventura counties.___ 1 p.m. san diego county officials have ordered mandatory evacuations due to a fast-moving fire fanned by santa ana winds. california state fire authorities say in a statement that the fire has destroyed two buildings and damaged 12. the fire was reported about 11 a.m. thursday near the rural community of bonsall and has grown to 150 acres (60 hectares) amid gusts up to 35 mph (56 kph). the evacuations include a mobile home park, a golf course country club and two schools. two lanes of interstate 15 are also closed.___ 11:30 a.m. residents are being ordered to evacuate a tiny beachfront community northwest of los angeles where a huge wildfire is churning down hillsides toward seaside homes. a california highway patrol officer drove through faria beach thursday announcing the evacuations through a loudspeaker as surging winds roiled smoke through the streets. residents used garden hoses to spray palm trees to keep them from burning as firefighters scrambled to stop the progress of flames. u.s. 101 along the coast was intermittently closed, as were several highways in and around the ventura county resort town of ojai (oh\\'-hi), where most of the 7,000 residents are under evacuation orders. thousands of homes remain threatened by at least four major southern california wildfires that have destroyed structures and sent residents fleeing.___ 8:45 a.m. a sheriff\\'s official says a woman has been found dead after a car crash in an area under a mandatory evacuation order as the largest of the wildfires raged in southern california. ventura county sheriff\\'s sgt. kevin donoghue tells the associated press that the woman\\'s body was found wednesday night at the scene of a crash in the wheeler canyon area of santa paula. donoghue says the car was found off the roadway after what appeared to be a single-car crash. he says there were no witnesses to the crash, but no foul play is suspected. donoghue says investigators were still trying to determine if the death was connected to the wildfires or if the person was trying to evacuate from the area. the woman\\'s name hasn\\'t been released and a cause of death is still being determined.___ 6:45 a.m. southern california authorities have ordered evacuations for the first time in santa barbara county as crews protect coastal communities from a destructive wildfire that\\'s steadily marching west and northwest. a key stretch of u.s. 101 between ventura and santa barbara counties was intermittently closed thursday as flames jumped lanes. residents of 300 homes in the oceanfront city of carpinteria were ordered to leave before dawn. a few miles down the coast, crews beat back flames creeping down hillsides toward the seaside hamlet of la conchita, where at least one abandoned structure burned. in los angeles county firefighters are watching for flare-ups as they try to contain three major blazes that have destroyed homes and sent thousands fleeing. forecasters say a more favorable wind forecast still calls for potentially dangerous gusts across the region. californians reflect after fleeing homes as fire came closethey ran for their lives by the thousands when the devastating wildfires raced across a huge swath of brush-covered southern california hillsides, and they survived even if in many cases their homes didn\\'t. some lost everything. others returned to find homes still standing but in danger a second time when flames that had seemed to spare them returned. others told of driving through a wall of flames to safety. here are some of their stories. ___ brian bromberg and wendy frank had just saved their beloved horses from a raging wildfire for the second time when they experienced their own brush with death - for the third time. the couple, who live in the mountainous artist colony of ojai, had already escaped flames that had burned down neighbors\\' homes and had gone back to rescue their horses from a boarding facility when they were headed to a hotel in santa barbara on wednesday night. suddenly they were confronted by a wall of flames lining both sides of u.s. highway 101. \"i thought we were in a schwarzenegger movie,\" bromberg, 57, recalled at the evacuation shelter in ventura on thursday as he comforted his horses. \"literally we drove through a 20-foot wall of flame and embers and blew through it. we must have been going 100 miles per hour,\" bromberg said. \"that was hot, and we were in the car and could feel it.\" earlier wednesday, the couple of five years was sitting down for dinner when frank decided to check on their four horses. the pair had just left them at a boarding facility 10 miles (16 kilometers) from their home, where they thought they would be safe. \"i just had a feeling and i reached out to a man we know who lives close to where they were being housed and he said, \\'you need to get here right away, you need to get them out. the whole area is going to be engulfed by fire,\\'\" she said. the day before, frank was on a business trip while bromberg was home, using buckets of water to douse flames approaching the couple\\'s ranch. \"the house on the other side of us lost a barn and an outbuilding, the place on the other side of us - the whole property burned down, and the place behind us was a wall of flames and i\\'m standing in the middle of this by myself with a bucket of water going to hotspots, pouring it out all day long and keeping the barn hosed with water,\" he said bromberg, a grammy-nominated jazz musician, and frank, a technology security expert at pricewaterhousecoopers, say they don\\'t plan to return to their house again until they are certain the area is out of danger. \"i feel blessed to be alive. somebody is taking care of us,\" bromberg said. ___ tom and pam prinz had just reached a deal to sell their ventura home and were planning to hand the keys over to the new owners last monday. the sale\\'s closing was delayed at the last minute, however, and on monday night the home where the couple raised their three children burned to the ground. they had been planning for several years to move to the san francisco bay area, where their children now live, and had just gotten their belongings out of the home. \"it\\'s just crazy timing,\" their distraught daughter chrissy prinz said thursday by phone from the oakland home where she\\'ll live in the granny flat behind her parents\\' new residence. \"my dad just retired. we were supposed to turn over the keys the day of the fire.\" escrow was delayed when paperwork was filed late. now the couple is looking to collect on the insurance policy, which fortunately they kept in force through the day after the fire. their daughter said the insurance money likely won\\'t be what they would have gotten from the sale, however, and she doesn\\'t know when anyone will want to buy and rebuild on a lot located in a neighborhood filled with burned-down homes. growing up in the hills overlooking ventura, she said, it wasn\\'t uncommon to see water-dropping aircraft in the area, which is hit by wildfires every few years. but no flames had ever gotten close to her family\\'s home before. \"our house is in the middle of the tract. we never would have expected it to burn,\" she said. ___ steve andruszkewicz and his neighbor joseph ruffner returned to their faria beach colony homes just north of ventura on thursday to discover the flames that appeared to have spared the houses were threatening them once again. \"i thought we were done yesterday,\" ruffner said, adding he and his family returned to their home in the morning to see a wall of fire that seemed to be a safe distance away. but then it moved in, spraying hot embers onto the neighborhood. \"it\\'s coming back to burn what it didn\\'t burn yesterday,\" he said. firefighters urged people to leave the beachfront community, where electricity was out. \"we\\'re leaving,\" andruszkewicz said as he and his wife sprayed palm trees with water from garden hoses first. ruffner said he was staying put. \"i bought a generator yesterday so at least i can see on tv what\\'s going on,\" he said. ___ marolyn romero-sim wept as she sat on a cot at an evacuation center recounting how the modest rv her family called home was destroyed by the largest and most destructive southern california wildfire. \"everything is ashes. everything. we don\\'t have a place to live. we lost stuff we can\\'t get back,\" she said. she said her husband, hugo romero-rodriguez, was wracked with guilt that he couldn\\'t get inside to rescue anything - including their beloved little dog, coqueta. she was trapped in a crate inside when the vehicle erupted in flames. romero-rodriguez suffered cuts on his leg and hand and a burn on his arm trying to get inside to save coqueta. \"he was sitting there in the driver\\'s seat and he couldn\\'t move,\" romero-sim said wednesday, recalling how she, her husband and their 9-year-old daughter, milagros, sat in their truck, watching the rv burn before finally realizing they had to flee their ventura county neighborhood. \"he just kept watching and he feels so guilty that he couldn\\'t save it,\" she continued. \"i told him he did everything he could and he did what he had to save our lives.\" romero-rodriguez makes a modest living as a jewelry salesman and he lost the pearls, earrings, bracelets and watches that made up his inventory.california sent fire danger text alert to 12 million peoplemillions of southern californians already dealing with a siege of destructive wildfires received an unprecedented text alert warning them to be ready for extreme fire potential early thursday, but conditions turned out to be less dire than predicted even though strong santa ana winds were blowing.kelly huston, deputy director of the state office of emergency services, said it was the broadest alert the office has ever sent and reached an estimated 12 million people in seven counties. \"i would rather be criticized for potentially annoying someone, than for not delivering a critical alert under these dangerous fire conditions,\" huston said. the office erred on the side of caution because conditions were similar to those that led to 44 deaths in wind-whipped fires that broke out across northern california on oct. 8, he said. many residents of the northern california fire zones have complained they did not receive alerts, and their representatives announced thursday they will introduce legislation to establish statewide emergency alert protocols and require all counties to adopt up-to-date systems with operators trained to implement evacuations. the alert sent wednesday night to southern california only advised of dangerous conditions, not evacuations. it said: \"strong winds overnight creating extreme fire danger. stay alert. listen to authorities.\" the alert came hours after ken pimlott, director of the california department of forestry and fire protection, told reporters that a color-coded danger scale had reached purple, which was never used previously, and winds could reach 80 mph. purple is part of the \"santa ana wildfire threat index \" produced by the u.s. forest service, the national interagency coordination center\\'s predictive services and other collaborators to categorize santa ana winds according to fire potential. the threat index uses a predictive model that incorporates moisture levels of dead and live vegetation and weather models, including wind speeds and atmospheric moisture, to produce a six-day forecast for potentially large fires. the result is then compared to climate data and the historical record of fires to create the rating. on thursday, the national weather service said there was a \"burst\" of winds wednesday night that subsided and that it appeared models may have \"over forecast\" thursday\\'s wind event. nonetheless, parts of southern california still were buffeted by strong winds, including 88 mph (142 kph) in san diego county and 85 mph (137 kph) in ventura county, where the largest fire is burning.',\n",
